user-invocable: false
---

# Commands Standards

Standards for every command in `plugin/commands/`. Apply when creating or reviewing plugin commands.

---

## Scope

This standard applies to commands shipped with the SDD plugin — all `.md` files found in `plugin/commands/`. It does not apply to the repo's own `.claude/skills/`.

---

## Frontmatter

Every command file must start with YAML frontmatter containing exactly these fields:

```yaml
---
name: sdd-my-command          # REQUIRED — kebab-case, prefixed with "sdd-"
description: >                # REQUIRED — what this command does, shown in help
  Manage project configuration - generate merged configs,
  validate, diff environments.
---
```

| Field | Type | Rule |
|-------|------|------|
| `name` | `string` | kebab-case, prefixed with `sdd-`, matches the filename without `.md` extension |
| `description` | `string` | 1-2 sentences. What the command does from the user's perspective. Written for the help listing — concise and action-oriented. |

**No other frontmatter fields.** Additional metadata belongs in the command body.

---

## Role of Commands

Commands are the user-facing entry points of the plugin. Users invoke them via `/command-name` in Claude Code. A command's job is to **orchestrate** — not to implement logic directly. Commands:

1. Parse arguments and validate inputs
2. Interact with the user (prompts, confirmations, option selection)
3. Delegate work to skills (via `INVOKE`) and the CLI (via `sdd-system`)
4. Display formatted output and next steps

Commands sit at the top of the invocation hierarchy:

```text
User → Command (user-facing, orchestrates)
Command → Skill (prompt-layer work: solicitation, decomposition, planning)
Command → Agent (specialized implementation: backend-dev, api-designer)
Command → CLI (system-layer work: scaffolding, validation, file operations)
```

A command must never contain implementation logic that belongs in a skill, agent, or the CLI. If a command's action section grows beyond orchestration (argument parsing, INVOKE directives, state transitions, output formatting), the logic should be extracted into a skill.

---

## Self-Containment

A command must be fully understandable on its own. An LLM reading a single command file should know exactly what the command does, what arguments it accepts, what it invokes, and what the user sees — without reading other commands.

### Rules

1. **Delegate clearly** — When invoking a skill or agent, state what you pass in and what you expect back. The reader should understand the delegation contract without reading the skill.
2. **Don't duplicate** — Never copy skill definitions, agent workflows, or CLI implementation details into the command. If a skill defines the spec solicitation flow, the command says "INVOKE spec-solicitation" with its inputs — it doesn't reproduce the solicitation steps.
3. **No cross-command file references** — Never reference or read files inside another command's definition. Each command is self-contained.
4. **No environment assumptions** — Do not assume a specific directory structure, tool version, or runtime context unless the command explicitly documents it as a precondition. If the command requires files to exist (e.g., `.sdd/sdd-settings.yaml`), state that as a precondition.
5. **Define your own terms** — If the command introduces domain-specific vocabulary, define it on first use. Don't define terms that belong to skills — delegate instead.
6. **Complete examples** — Every example must be understandable without external context. Include the arguments, expected output, and any state changes.

---

## User Interaction

Commands are the **only** layer that interacts directly with the user. Unlike agents (which have no user channel) and skills (which are instructional context), commands define the conversation flow.

### Rules

1. **Explicit interaction points** — Every point where the command pauses for user input must be documented with the exact prompt text and available options. Implicit "ask the user" is not sufficient — show what the user sees.
2. **Options format** — When presenting options, use a numbered list or lettered choices. Always include a cancel/exit option where appropriate.
3. **Confirmation before destructive actions** — Any action that modifies existing files, resets state, or archives artifacts must show a preview and request explicit confirmation.
4. **Progressive disclosure** — Show summaries first, details on request. Don't dump walls of output. Use structured formatting (tables, indented lists, boxed headers) to make output scannable.
5. **Next steps always** — Every terminal output must end with a `NEXT STEPS` section telling the user what to do next. The user should never be left wondering "what now?".
6. **Error messages are actionable** — When validation fails or a precondition is unmet, show what's wrong, why it's wrong, and how to fix it. Never display a raw error without context.

### BAD

```markdown
## Flow
1. Check if branch is main
2. Ask user about the branch
3. Continue
```

The reader doesn't know what the user sees, what the options are, or what happens for each choice.

### GOOD

```markdown
## Flow
1. Run `git branch --show-current`
2. If on `main`/`master`:
   ```
   You're on the main branch. Feature work should happen on a feature branch.

   Suggested branch: feature/user-auth

   [1] Create branch and switch (recommended)
   [2] Continue on main
   [3] Cancel
   ```
3. If user selects [1]: create and checkout the branch
4. Otherwise proceed on current branch
```

The reader knows exactly what the user sees and what each option does.

---

## Skill and Agent Invocation

Commands delegate work to skills and agents using the `INVOKE` directive. This is the standard format for documenting delegation in command files.

### INVOKE format

```yaml
INVOKE <skill-or-agent-name> with:
  param1: <value or description>
  param2: <value or description>
```

For skills with methods (e.g., workflow-state):

```yaml
INVOKE <skill-name>.<method> with:
  param1: <value>
```

### Rules

1. **Every INVOKE must specify inputs** — List every parameter the skill or agent receives. Use `<angle brackets>` for dynamic values and plain text for literals.
2. **Document expected output** — After the INVOKE, state what the command expects back (e.g., "Returns `workflow_id` for tracking."). The reader should know the shape of the result without reading the skill.
3. **Only invoke skills and agents that exist** — Every skill name in the command must correspond to an actual `SKILL.md` somewhere under `plugin/skills/` (scan recursively). Every agent name must correspond to an `.md` file in `plugin/agents/`. Referencing nonexistent skills or agents creates silent failures.
4. **Invocations are sequential within a flow** — Document invocations in the order they execute. If an invocation depends on a previous result, show the data flow explicitly (e.g., `workflow_id: <from step 3>`).
5. **No inline skill logic** — If you find yourself writing the steps a skill performs inside the command, you're duplicating. Replace with an INVOKE and a one-line summary of what the skill returns.

---

## CLI Integration

Commands may call the `sdd-system` CLI for deterministic, system-layer operations (file creation, validation, version bumping). This is a different delegation path than INVOKE — CLI calls are shell executions, not prompt-layer context loading.

### Format

```markdown
## Implementation

This command invokes `sdd-system` CLI subcommands:

```bash
sdd-system <namespace> <action> [args] [options]
```
```

Or inline within a flow step:

```markdown
4. Run `sdd-system config validate --env <env>`
5. If validation fails, display errors and exit
```

### Rules

1. **Use `sdd-system` by name** — Always reference the CLI as `sdd-system`, not by its file path. The execution wrapper (`node --enable-source-maps "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/system/dist/cli.js"`) should appear at most once in the command, in an `## Execution` section.
2. **CLI for deterministic work only** — The CLI handles file operations, validation, and code generation. If the operation requires judgment, context, or conversation, use a skill or agent instead.
3. **Document error handling** — When a CLI command can fail (validation errors, missing files), document what the command shows the user and whether execution continues or stops.
4. **No CLI implementation details** — The command documents what CLI subcommand to call and what it returns. It does not document how the CLI implements the operation internally.

---

## Actions and Subcommands

Commands with multiple operations use an actions pattern. Each action is a distinct workflow the user can invoke.

### Structure

```markdown
## Usage

```
/sdd-command <action> [args] [options]
```

## Actions

| Action | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `new` | Create a new item | `/sdd-command new --name foo` |
| `status` | Show current state | `/sdd-command status` |

## Action: new

### Usage
...

### Arguments
| Argument | Required | Description |
...

### Flow
1. ...
2. ...

### Output
...
```

### Rules

1. **Actions table first** — Before any action detail sections, provide a summary table of all actions with one-line descriptions and examples.
2. **One section per action** — Each action gets its own `## Action: <name>` section (or `### <name>` for simpler commands). Never mix multiple actions in one section.
3. **Consistent subsection order** — Within each action: Usage, Arguments (if any), Flow, Output. Optional: Prerequisites, Examples.
4. **Simple commands skip actions** — Commands with a single operation (e.g., `/sdd-init`) don't need the actions pattern. Use `## Workflow` or `## Flow` directly.

---

## Output Formatting

Commands produce user-facing terminal output. Consistent formatting makes the plugin feel cohesive and professional.

### Conventions

| Element | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Section headers | `═══════` box with centered title |
| Success indicator | `✓` (check mark) |
| Failure indicator | `✗` (cross mark) |
| Warning indicator | `⚠` (warning sign) |
| Indented details | Two-space indent under parent |
| Status tables | Aligned columns with `─────` separator |
| Next steps | `NEXT STEPS:` header with numbered items |

### Rules

1. **Show the exact output** — Document the literal terminal output the user sees in fenced code blocks (no language tag for terminal output). The implementer should be able to copy-paste the format.
2. **Structured, not conversational** — Output uses tables, aligned columns, and headers — not paragraphs of prose. Users scan terminal output; they don't read it.
3. **Status indicators are consistent** — Use `✓`/`✗`/`⚠` across all commands. Don't invent custom indicators.
4. **Box headers for major milestones** — Use the `═══════` box format for completion messages and major state transitions. Don't use it for intermediate steps.

---

## State Persistence

Commands that span multiple sessions must persist their state to disk so work survives session boundaries.

### Rules

1. **Zero session context** — A new session must be able to resume the command's workflow by reading persisted state alone. The command must never rely on conversation history.
2. **Document state location** — State file paths (e.g., `.sdd/workflows/`) must be explicitly documented in the command. The reader should know where to look.
3. **Document state transitions** — Each action that changes state must show the before/after status values. Use a table or inline notation (e.g., `spec_review → plan_review`).
4. **Checkpoint commits** — Commands that modify project files across multiple steps should create checkpoint commits on feature branches. Document when checkpoints happen.

---

## Command Structure

After the frontmatter, organize the command body as follows:

```
# /command-name                    <- H1, with leading slash
One-line summary paragraph.        <- What this command does

## Usage                           <- Syntax with code block
## Actions                         <- (if multi-action) Summary table
## Action: <name>                  <- (if multi-action) Per-action detail
  ### Usage
  ### Arguments
  ### Flow
  ### Output
## <Supporting Sections>           <- Merge algorithm, workflow, etc.
## Important Notes                 <- (recommended) Key constraints, edge cases
## Related                         <- (recommended) Related commands and skills
```

### Writing rules

- **H1 with slash** — The H1 title includes the leading slash (e.g., `# /sdd-config`), matching how the user invokes it.
- **Headings** — H1 for the title, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections within actions. No deeper.
- **Code blocks** — Use language tags for code (`bash`, `yaml`, `typescript`). Use no language tag for terminal output (the formatted text the user sees).
- **Tables** — Use for arguments, actions summaries, settings, and comparisons.
- **Flow steps** — Numbered lists for sequential workflows. Each step is one action (validate, invoke, display).
- **INVOKE blocks** — Use `yaml` language tag for INVOKE directives within flow steps.
- **Rationale** — Explain *why* a design choice exists, not just *what* it is. Especially for non-obvious constraints (e.g., why checkpoints use `--no-verify`).

---

## Drift Risk Scoring

Some commands are structurally more likely to drift than others. During audit or review, score each command to prioritize monitoring effort. Higher scores mean more drift surfaces — not that the command is broken today, but that it is more likely to break tomorrow.

### Risk factors

| Risk Factor | Points | Rationale |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Each INVOKE directive (skill/agent) | +1 | More invocations = more surfaces that can change |
| Each vague INVOKE (no inputs/outputs specified) | +2 | Vague invocations drift silently — the skill evolves but the command's assumption doesn't |
| Each CLI command reference | +1 | CLI interfaces change across versions; the command may reference stale subcommands or flags |
| Each hardcoded file path | +1 | Paths change during refactors; the command won't know |
| Each duplicated concept from a skill or agent | +3 | Duplicated content drifts silently; the source of truth evolves but the copy doesn't |
| Each cross-command file reference | +3 | Hidden coupling that breaks on restructure |
| Each environment assumption without documented precondition | +1 | Implicit assumptions break silently in new environments |
| Each action with more than 8 flow steps | +1 | Long flows are harder to maintain and more likely to accumulate drift |

### Risk tiers

| Score | Tier | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| 0–3 | **Low** | Standard audit cadence |
| 4–6 | **Moderate** | Review when any invoked skill, agent, or CLI command changes |
| 7+ | **High** | Prioritize in every audit; consider splitting into subcommands or extracting logic into skills |

### In the audit report

Include a drift risk summary table:

```markdown
## Drift Risk Scores

| Command | Score | Tier | Top Factors |
|---------|-------|------|-------------|
| sdd-config | 3 | Low | 4 CLI refs (+4) |
| sdd-change | 12 | High | 8 INVOKEs (+8), 3 vague refs (+6), 12-step flow (+1) |
```

## Audit Procedure

Run this audit against all plugin commands to produce a fresh violations report. Find every `.md` file in `plugin/commands/`, then check each command against the categories below.

### What to check per command

For each command file, check every item in the **Checklist** section above. Additionally:

1. **Skill/agent existence** — For every INVOKE directive, verify the referenced skill has a `SKILL.md` somewhere under `plugin/skills/` (glob recursively, match on the `name` frontmatter field). For agent references, verify a matching `.md` file exists in `plugin/agents/`.
2. **INVOKE completeness** — Every INVOKE must list its input parameters. Flag any INVOKE that says only "invoke skill-name" without specifying what data is passed.
3. **Output consistency** — Compare formatting patterns across all commands. Flag any command that uses different status indicators, header styles, or next-steps formatting than the conventions documented above.
4. **Cross-command overlap** — Check that no two commands claim the same action or duplicate the same workflow. If overlap exists, one should delegate to the other.
5. **Staleness indicators** — For each invoked skill or CLI subcommand, check whether it still exists and whether the command's description of it matches its current behavior.

### Report format

Produce the report with these sections:

```markdown
# Commands Standards Audit — YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM

## Summary

| Category | Passing | Failing | Total |
|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| Frontmatter | X | Y | Z |
| Self-containment | ... | ... | ... |
| User interaction | ... | ... | ... |
| INVOKE directives | ... | ... | ... |
| CLI integration | ... | ... | ... |
| Output formatting | ... | ... | ... |
| State persistence | ... | ... | ... |

## Drift Risk Scores

| Command | Score | Tier | Top Factors |
|---------|-------|------|-------------|

## Staleness Report
<!-- Per-command skill/agent/CLI reference validation -->

## Output Consistency Report
<!-- Cross-command formatting comparison -->

## Per-Command Violations
<!-- One subsection per failing command, with quoted violations -->

## Recommended Fix Priority
<!-- Ordered by impact and effort -->
```

### Report output location

**Never write audit reports inside `plugin/commands/`.** The plugin folder is for shipped command files only — no reports, scratch files, or artifacts.

After presenting the report, **ask the user** whether to create a task to track the fixes or whether the report is temporary (e.g., for quick review or one-off investigation). If the user wants a task:

Create a task via `/tasks add "Fix commands standards violations from audit report"`. The task's purpose is to **fix the violations** — the audit report is supporting evidence, not the deliverable. Save the report with a timestamped filename inside the task folder:

```
.tasks/1-inbox/<N>/
├── task.md                                      # Task to fix violations, with key findings summary
└── commands-audit-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.md           # Full audit report (e.g., commands-audit-2026-02-07_14-30.md)
```

If the user declines, present the report inline without creating any files or tasks.

### How to run

Ask: "Audit all plugin commands against the commands-standards skill and produce a violations report."

Run the audit directly (do not delegate to subagents):

1. Glob for all `plugin/commands/*.md` files
2. Read each file completely
3. Check every item from the Checklist above, plus the additional audit-specific checks
4. For skill existence checks, glob `plugin/skills/**/SKILL.md` (recursive) and match each referenced skill name against the `name` frontmatter field of found skills
5. For agent existence checks, glob `plugin/agents/*.md` and match agent names against filenames
6. Present the report to the user
7. Ask the user whether to create a task (via `/tasks add "Fix commands standards violations from audit report"`) or keep the report temporary

## Input / Output

This skill defines no input parameters or structured output.
