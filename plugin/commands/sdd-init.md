# /sdd-init

Initialize a new spec-driven project, optionally from an existing external specification.

## Usage

```
/sdd-init --name <project-name> [--spec <path-to-external-spec>]
```

**Arguments:**
- `--name <project-name>` (required): Name of the project directory to create
- `--spec <path>` (optional): Path to an external specification file to use as the initial spec

**Examples:**
```bash
# Standard initialization
/sdd-init --name my-app

# Initialize from existing spec
/sdd-init --name my-app --spec /path/to/existing-spec.md
```

## Workflow

**CRITICAL**: This command follows an approval-based workflow. Do NOT create any files or directories until the user has approved the project configuration.

**Permission Note**: This command creates ~50+ files. If the user hasn't configured SDD permissions, they will see many approval prompts. If you notice excessive prompts during execution, mention that they can reduce prompts by configuring permissions per `plugin/docs/permissions.md`.

This command orchestrates multiple skills to complete initialization:

| Phase | Skill Used                  | Purpose |
|-------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| 0     | (inline)                    | Parse arguments |
| 1     | `product-discovery`         | Understand what user is building |
| 2     | `component-recommendation`  | Recommend technical components |
| 3     | (inline)                    | Display configuration summary |
| 4     | (inline)                    | Get user approval |
| 5     | (inline)                    | Initialize git   |
| 6.1   | `project-settings`          | Create sdd-settings.yaml |
| 6.2   | `scaffolding`               | Create project structure |
| 6.3   | `domain-population`         | Populate specs from discovery |
| 7     | `external-spec-integration` | Process external spec (if provided) |
| 8     | (inline)                    | Commit initial project files |
| 9     | (inline)                    | Display completion report |

---

## Phase Tracking (CRITICAL)

**You MUST complete ALL phases before declaring initialization complete.** Use this checklist to track progress:

```
[ ] Phase 0: Arguments parsed, spec outline extracted (if --spec)
[ ] Phase 1: Product discovery completed, results stored
[ ] Phase 2: Component recommendation completed
[ ] Phase 3: Configuration summary displayed
[ ] Phase 4: User approval received
[ ] Phase 5: Git repository initialized
[ ] Phase 6.1: sdd-settings.yaml created
[ ] Phase 6.2: Project structure scaffolded
[ ] Phase 6.3: Domain knowledge populated
[ ] Phase 7: External spec integrated (if --spec provided)
[ ] Phase 8: Initial commit created
[ ] Phase 9: Completion report displayed
```

**DO NOT:**
- Stop after Phase 4 (approval) without completing Phases 5-9
- Skip Phase 7 when `--spec` was provided
- Declare "initialization complete" until Phase 9 is finished
- Ask the user "should I continue?" between phases - just proceed

**If interrupted**, resume from the last incomplete phase. The user should never need to ask "is init done?" - you must complete all phases in a single flow.

---

### Phase 0: Parse Arguments

1. **If no arguments provided**, display usage and exit:
   ```
   Usage: /sdd-init --name <project-name> [--spec <path>]

   Arguments:
     --name <project-name>  Name of the project directory to create (required)
     --spec <path>          Path to external specification file (optional)

   Examples:
     /sdd-init --name my-app
     /sdd-init --name my-app --spec /path/to/spec.md
   ```
   **Do not proceed without at least `--name`.**

2. **Parse command arguments:**
   - Extract project name (required)
   - Extract spec path (if provided)

3. **If external spec is provided:**
   - Validate path exists
   - **Determine spec type:**
     - **If path is a file:** Use that file directly
     - **If path is a directory:**
       1. Look for entry point file in order: `README.md`, `SPEC.md`, `index.md`, `spec.md`
       2. If no entry point found, collect all `.md` files in the directory
       3. Store: `spec_is_directory: true`, `spec_files: [list of .md files]`
       4. Display: "Loaded spec directory: <path> ({N} markdown files found)"

   - **Extract outline** (chunked, no LLM needed):
     - For single file: Extract headers from that file
     - For directory: Extract headers from all files, prefixed with filename
     ```
     INVOKE spec-decomposition skill with:
       mode: "outline"
       spec_content: <file content or concatenated content>
       spec_is_directory: <true if directory>
       spec_files: <list of files if directory>
     ```
   - Store: `spec_outline` (sections with line ranges and source file)
   - Store: `spec_path` (absolute path to original spec file or directory)
   - Display: "Loaded external spec from: <path> ({N} sections found)"

   Note: The spec remains at its original location until Phase 7, when it's copied into the project.

4. **Directory check:**
   - Validate project name (lowercase, hyphens allowed)
   - Check if current directory basename matches project name
   - If match and empty: Ask "Initialize here? (yes/no)"
   - If match and not empty: "Will create subdirectory '<project-name>/' instead."
   - Determine target directory for later phases

---

### Phase 1: Product Discovery

**INVOKE the `product-discovery` skill** with:

```yaml
project_name: <from Phase 0>
spec_outline: <if --spec provided, else null>
spec_path: <if --spec provided, else null>
```

Note: The skill will read only the intro section using the outline's line ranges.

The skill conducts interactive discovery and returns:

```yaml
product_description: "1-2 sentence problem statement"
primary_domain: "Task Management"
user_personas:
  - type: "Project Manager"
    actions: "create projects, assign tasks"
core_workflows: ["Create projects", "Assign tasks"]
domain_entities: ["Team", "Project", "Task"]
integrations: ["Slack"]
constraints: []
scope: "mvp"
```

Store these results for subsequent phases.

---

### Phase 2: Technical Recommendation

**INVOKE the `component-recommendation` skill** with:

```yaml
discovery_results:
  product_description: <from Phase 1>
  primary_domain: <from Phase 1>
  user_personas: <from Phase 1>
  core_workflows: <from Phase 1>
  domain_entities: <from Phase 1>
  integrations: <from Phase 1>
  constraints: <from Phase 1>
  scope: <from Phase 1>
```

The skill recommends components and returns:

```yaml
project_type: "fullstack"
components:
  - type: contract
    name: contract
  - type: server
    name: server
  - type: webapp
    name: webapp
  - type: database
    name: database
  - type: helm
    name: helm
  - type: testing
    name: testing
  - type: cicd
    name: cicd
```

Store configuration for subsequent phases.

---

### Phase 3: Configuration Summary

Display a summary combining product context and technical configuration:

```markdown
## Project Configuration Summary

### Product Understanding

**Name:** <project-name>
**Problem:** <product_description>
**Domain:** <primary_domain>

**Users:**
- <User type 1>: <what they do>
- <User type 2>: <what they do>

**Core Capabilities:**
- <Capability 1>
- <Capability 2>

**Key Domain Entities:** <Entity1>, <Entity2>, <Entity3>
[**Integrations:** <list if any>]
[**Constraints:** <list if any>]

### Technical Configuration

**Location:** <target_directory>

**Components to create:**
- Contract (OpenAPI spec) - for <entities/workflows>
- Server (Node.js backend) - to handle <workflows>
- Webapp (React frontend) - for <user types>
- Database (PostgreSQL) - to persist <entities>
- Config (YAML configuration)
- Helm (Kubernetes deployment)
- Testing setup
- CI/CD workflows

### What Will Be Pre-populated

- **Glossary:** <Entity1>, <Entity2>, <Entity3>
- **User Personas:** <User type 1>, <User type 2>
- **Initial Use Cases:** Stubs for <Capability 1>, <Capability 2>

**Files to create:** ~XX files
```

---

### Phase 4: User Approval

**CRITICAL:** Ask the user explicitly:

```
Do you want to proceed with creating this project structure? (yes/no)
```

**DO NOT create any files until the user confirms with "yes".**

If the user says no, ask what they'd like to change and return to Phase 1 or Phase 2.

---

### Phase 5: Initialize Git Repository

Create the project directory (if it doesn't already exist) and initialize git before writing any project files:

If not already in a git repository:
```bash
mkdir -p ${TARGET_DIR} && cd ${TARGET_DIR} && git init
```

If already in a git repository (current directory case):
- Skip this phase (git is already initialized)

---

### Phase 6: Project Creation (Only After Approval)

#### Step 6.1: Create Project Settings

**INVOKE the `project-settings` skill** with operation `create`:

```yaml
plugin_version: <read from plugin's .claude-plugin/plugin.json>
project_name: <from Phase 0>
project_description: <from Phase 1>
project_domain: <from Phase 1>
project_type: <from Phase 2>
components: <from Phase 2>
```

Creates `sdd-settings.yaml` in the project root.

#### Step 6.2: Scaffold Project Structure

**INVOKE the `scaffolding` skill** with:

```yaml
project_name: <from Phase 0>
project_description: <from Phase 1>
primary_domain: <from Phase 1>
target_dir: <absolute path to target>
components: <from Phase 2>
```

#### Step 6.3: Populate Domain Knowledge

**INVOKE the `domain-population` skill** with:

```yaml
target_dir: <absolute path to target>
primary_domain: <from Phase 1>
product_description: <from Phase 1>
user_personas: <from Phase 1>
core_workflows: <from Phase 1>
domain_entities: <from Phase 1>
```

---

### Phase 7: External Spec Integration (if --spec provided)

**Only if external spec was provided via `--spec` argument.**

**INVOKE the `external-spec-integration` skill** with:

```yaml
spec_path: <absolute path to external spec>
spec_outline: <from Phase 0>
target_dir: <absolute path to project>
primary_domain: <from Phase 1>
```

The skill:
1. Copies external spec to `specs/external/`
2. Presents outline to user for boundary level selection
3. Analyzes each section individually (using outline line ranges)
4. Presents combined decomposition for user adjustment
5. Creates change specifications
6. Updates INDEX.md and glossary

---

### Phase 8: Commit Initial Project Files

Stage and commit all created files:
```bash
cd ${TARGET_DIR} && git add . && git commit -m "Initial project setup from spec-driven template"
```

---

### Phase 9: Completion Report

1. List the created structure:
   ```bash
   tree ${TARGET_DIR} -L 3 -I node_modules
   ```

2. Display completion message:

**If external spec was provided:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 PROJECT INITIALIZED: <project-name>
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Location: <absolute-path-to-target-dir>
Description: <project-description>
Primary Domain: <primary-domain>

External spec archived: specs/external/<filename> (audit only)
Changes created: N

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CHANGES TO REVIEW (in implementation order)                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. change-1 (feature): Brief description                    │
│    → specs/changes/YYYY/MM/DD/change-1/SPEC.md              │
│                                                             │
│ 2. change-2 (feature): Brief description                    │
│    → specs/changes/YYYY/MM/DD/change-2/SPEC.md              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

⚠️  IMPORTANT: Implementation must use the generated SPEC.md files only.
    Do NOT reference specs/external/ - it exists for audit purposes only.

NEXT: Review the first change specification

I recommend reviewing the generated change specs to ensure they
accurately capture your requirements before implementation.

Would you like me to:
  [R] Review the first change spec (specs/changes/YYYY/MM/DD/<first-change>/SPEC.md)
  [L] List all change specs with summaries
  [I] Start implementing the first change (/sdd-implement-change)
```

**IMPORTANT:** After displaying this report, wait for user input. Do NOT proceed to implement changes without user direction.

**If standard initialization:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 PROJECT INITIALIZED: <project-name>
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Location: <absolute-path-to-target-dir>
Description: <project-description>
Primary Domain: <primary-domain>
Components created: <list>

Next steps:
  1. cd <project-name> (if not current directory)
  2. npm install --workspaces
  3. cd components/<contract-component-name> && npm run generate:types
  4. Review: specs/domain/glossary.md, components/<contract-component-name>/openapi.yaml
  5. Create first change: /sdd-new-change --type feature --name <name>
```

**VERIFICATION:** Before displaying the completion report, confirm:
- [ ] All phases 0-9 completed (check the Phase Tracking checklist)
- [ ] Git commit was successful (Phase 8)
- [ ] Tree structure displays correctly
- [ ] If --spec was provided: changes were created and paths are correct

---

## Important Notes

- This command ALWAYS asks for user approval before creating files
- Users can customize which components to include
- Product discovery enables pre-populated glossary, use-cases, and component recommendations
- External spec support includes multi-change decomposition with user adjustment
- All skills are invoked in sequence with proper data passing between phases
- **When --spec is provided**: After init, guide user to review changes (not install dependencies)
- **Completion means Phase 9**: Never declare "done" before the completion report is displayed
