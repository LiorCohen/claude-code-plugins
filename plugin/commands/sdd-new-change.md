description: Start a new change (feature, bugfix, refactor, or epic) by creating a spec and implementation plan.

# /sdd-new-change

Start a new change with a typed specification and implementation plan.

## Usage

```
/sdd-new-change --type <feature|bugfix|refactor|epic> --name <change-name>
```

**Arguments:**
- `--type` (required): Type of change - `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, or `epic`
- `--name` (required): Name for the change (lowercase, hyphens allowed)

**Examples:**
```bash
# New feature
/sdd-new-change --type feature --name user-authentication

# Bug fix
/sdd-new-change --type bugfix --name fix-session-timeout

# Refactor
/sdd-new-change --type refactor --name extract-validation-layer

# Epic (multiple features)
/sdd-new-change --type epic --name checkout-system
```

## Flow

### 1. Parse Arguments (CRITICAL - DO FIRST)

**First, parse and validate the arguments:**

1. **If no arguments provided**, display usage and exit:
   ```
   Usage: /sdd-new-change --type <feature|bugfix|refactor|epic> --name <change-name>

   Arguments:
     --type <type>  Type of change: feature, bugfix, refactor, or epic (required)
     --name <name>  Name for the change directory (required)

   Examples:
     /sdd-new-change --type feature --name user-authentication
     /sdd-new-change --type bugfix --name fix-login-timeout
     /sdd-new-change --type refactor --name extract-auth-layer
   ```
   **Do not proceed without both arguments.**

2. **Validate `--type`:**
   - Must be one of: `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `epic`
   - If invalid, show error: "Invalid type '<type>'. Must be one of: feature, bugfix, refactor"

3. **Validate `--name`:**
   - Must be valid directory name (lowercase, hyphens allowed, no spaces)
   - If invalid, show error and requirements

**DO NOT proceed to Step 2 until both arguments are validated.**

### 2. Check Git Branch

**Now that we have the change info, check the branch:**

1. Run `git branch --show-current` to get the current branch name
2. If the current branch is `main` or `master`:
   - **STOP immediately**
   - Inform the user: "You are currently on the `main`/`master` branch."
   - Suggest: "Would you like to create a branch first? Suggested branch name: `<type>/<change-name>`"
     - Use the actual type and change name from Step 1 (e.g., `feature/user-auth`, `bugfix/fix-timeout`)
   - Wait for user response:
     - If user says yes: Ask if they want to use the suggested name or provide their own
     - If user provides a branch name: Create the branch with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
     - If user says no: Warn them that they're about to create files on main/master, ask for explicit confirmation
3. If on any other branch: Proceed to Step 3

**DO NOT proceed to Step 3 until the branch situation is resolved.**

### 3. Collect Change Information

Prompt for additional details based on change type:

**For all types:**
- Issue reference (required)
- Domain (e.g., "Identity", "Billing", "Core")
- Brief description (1-2 sentences)

**Additional prompts by type:**

**For `feature`:**
- (No additional required prompts - user stories and acceptance criteria can be added in the spec)

**For `bugfix`:**
- "What are the symptoms of this bug?"
- "What is the expected behavior?"
- (Root cause can be documented later after investigation)

**For `refactor`:**
- "What are the main goals of this refactor?"
- "Which files/modules are primarily affected?"

**For `epic`:**
- "What is the overall goal of this epic?"
- "What child changes (features) should this epic contain?" (collect names and brief descriptions)
- "Are there dependencies between the child changes?"

### 4. Create Change Spec and Plan

Use the `change-creation` skill to create the change. Invoke the skill with:

```
name: <collected change name>
type: <collected type>
title: <change name formatted as title>
description: <collected description>
domain: <collected domain>
issue: <collected issue reference>

# For bugfix type:
root_cause: <to be determined during investigation>
affected_files: <if provided>

# For refactor type:
refactor_goals: <collected goals>
affected_files: <collected files/modules>
```

The `change-creation` skill will:
1. Create change directory: `specs/changes/YYYY/MM/DD/<change-name>/`
2. Create SPEC.md with proper frontmatter and type-specific sections
3. Create PLAN.md with type-appropriate phases
4. Update INDEX.md with the new change entry (includes type indicator)

See `skills/change-creation/SKILL.md` for detailed specification.

### 5. Review

- Show both spec and plan to user
- Wait for confirmation before proceeding
- If user requests changes, edit the files accordingly

## Important Notes

- **Both arguments required**: The command will ALWAYS require `--type` and `--name` before proceeding
- **Branch check is mandatory**: After validating arguments, the command checks the current git branch
- **Feature branches recommended**: Working on `main`/`master` is discouraged
- **Suggested naming**: `<type>/<change-name>` follows common git workflow conventions (epics use `epic/<name>`)
- **Epic flow**: For epics, after creating the parent spec/plan, child change directories are created under `changes/`
- **Type-specific templates**: Each change type gets appropriate spec sections and plan phases
- **User control**: Users can override the branch suggestion and proceed on main/master if they explicitly confirm
