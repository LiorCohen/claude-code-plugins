# /sdd-implement-change

Implement a change by executing its implementation plan.

## Usage

```
/sdd-implement-change [path-to-change-dir]
```

Example:
```
/sdd-implement-change specs/changes/2026/01/11/user-auth
```

## Flow

### 1. Load Spec and Plan (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)

**CRITICAL**: Before starting ANY implementation work, you MUST:

- Read the ENTIRE PLAN.md from start to finish
- Read the ENTIRE SPEC.md referenced in the plan (same directory: `./SPEC.md`)
- Understand ALL requirements and acceptance criteria
- Verify all prerequisites are met (dependencies, environment, etc.)
- Create a mental model of the complete implementation
- Display comprehensive summary of ALL work to be done
- Identify any missing information or ambiguities

**DO NOT proceed to Phase 2 until you fully understand the complete scope.**

### 2. Execute Phase 0: Domain Documentation (REQUIRED BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION)

**CRITICAL**: Phase 0 from the plan MUST be completed before ANY code implementation. This ensures domain knowledge is documented before implementation begins:

1. **Glossary Updates** (`specs/domain/glossary.md`):
   - Read the spec's "Domain Concepts" section
   - Identify any new terms, definitions, or concepts introduced
   - Add or update definitions in the glossary
   - Ensure all domain-specific terminology is properly documented
   - If no new concepts: explicitly note "No glossary updates needed"

2. **Definition Documentation** (`specs/domain/definitions/`):
   - Identify new definitions introduced by the change
   - Create definition spec files for new domain definitions (e.g., `specs/domain/definitions/user.md`)
   - Update existing definition specs if properties/relationships change
   - Document definition properties, relationships, business rules, and lifecycle
   - If no definition changes: explicitly note "No definition updates needed"

3. **Architecture Documentation** (`specs/architecture/`):
   - Review if the change introduces new architectural patterns
   - Update `specs/architecture/overview.md` if components are affected
   - Document new integration points or service dependencies
   - Update API contracts documentation if endpoints change
   - If no architecture changes: explicitly note "No architecture updates needed"

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] Read spec's "Domain Concepts" section
- [ ] Updated `specs/domain/glossary.md` with new terms
- [ ] Created/updated definition specs in `specs/domain/definitions/`
- [ ] Updated architecture docs if needed
- [ ] Confirmed all domain changes from spec are documented

**DO NOT proceed to Phase 1 (API Contract) until Phase 0 is complete and verified.**

### 3. Execute Implementation Phases (Phases 1-5)

For each phase in the plan:

#### Phase: API Contract
- Invoke `api-designer` agent
- Update OpenAPI spec
- Generate types
- Verify types generated successfully

#### Phase: Backend Implementation
- Invoke `backend-dev` agent
- Implement model use-cases
- Add DAL methods
- Wire up controller
- Add server routes

#### Phase: Frontend Implementation
- Invoke `frontend-dev` agent
- Create React components
- Add hooks for API calls
- Integrate with UI

#### Phase: Infrastructure (if needed)
- Invoke `devops` agent
- Update Helm charts
- Add environment variables
- Create Testkube test definitions

#### Phase: Testing
- Invoke `tester` agent
- Create unit tests for all new code
- Create integration tests
- Create E2E tests
- Verify all acceptance criteria covered by tests
- **RUN all tests and ensure 100% pass**
- If tests fail, fix the implementation or tests until they pass
- Do NOT proceed to Review phase until all tests pass

#### Phase: Review
- Invoke `reviewer` agent
- Check spec compliance
- Invoke `db-advisor` if database changes present
- Report findings

### 3b. Epic Implementation (type: epic)

If the change directory contains a `changes/` subdirectory, this is an epic:

1. **Read epic PLAN.md** to determine change order and dependencies
2. **For each child change** (in dependency order from the epic plan):
   a. Create branch: `epic/<epic-name>/<change-name>`
   b. Implement the child change following its own PLAN.md (standard feature implementation flow)
   c. Ensure all tests pass
   d. Create PR for the child change
   e. After merge, update the epic PLAN.md progress tracking
3. **After all child changes are complete**, verify epic-level acceptance criteria

### 4. Track Progress

- Mark each phase as complete when done
- Report any blockers or issues
- Update PLAN.md with actual progress

### 5. Final Verification (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)

Before declaring implementation complete, you MUST:

1. **Full Spec Review**
   - Re-read the entire SPEC.md
   - Re-read the entire PLAN.md
   - Verify every requirement is addressed
   - Check all acceptance criteria are implemented

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Run ALL unit tests (`npm test` or equivalent)
   - Run ALL integration tests (via Testkube or locally)
   - Run ALL E2E tests
   - Ensure 100% of tests pass
   - If ANY test fails, fix it before proceeding

3. **Functionality Verification**
   - Verify each acceptance criterion manually if needed
   - Confirm all API endpoints work as specified
   - Validate frontend components match requirements
   - Check database schema matches design
   - Test error handling paths

4. **Code Review**
   - Re-invoke `reviewer` agent for final check
   - If database changes: invoke `db-advisor` agent
   - Address ALL findings before completion
   - Ensure no spec violations

5. **Documentation Check**
   - Verify all code is properly documented
   - Ensure telemetry is properly configured
   - Check that all required log fields are present
   - Validate OpenTelemetry spans are correct

6. **Final Report**
   - Generate implementation summary
   - List all files created/modified
   - Confirm all acceptance criteria met
   - Note any deviations from plan (with justification)

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT declare implementation complete until ALL of the above steps are finished and ALL tests pass. If you encounter ANY issues, resolve them before finishing.

## Important Notes

- **Domain docs first**: Domain documentation (glossary, definitions, architecture) MUST be updated before writing any code
- **Mandatory step**: Phase 2 (Update Domain Documentation) cannot be skipped, even if changes seem minor
- **Verification required**: Explicitly confirm each documentation area (glossary, definitions, architecture) is updated or doesn't need updates
- **Traceability**: Domain documentation serves as the bridge between specs and implementation
- **Single source of truth**: Ensures domain knowledge is centralized and accessible to all team members
