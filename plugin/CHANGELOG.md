# Changelog

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-11

### Changed

- **Command renamed**: `/project:implement-spec` → `/project:implement-plan`
  - Better reflects that the command implements from a plan (which references a spec)
  - Command now takes path to PLAN.md instead of SPEC.md
  - Example: `/project:implement-plan specs/features/2026/01/11/user-auth/PLAN.md`

### Updated Files

- **implement-plan command** (renamed from implement-spec.md):
  - Updated command name, description, and usage examples
  - Changed to read PLAN.md first, then SPEC.md from same directory
  - Updated flow documentation to reflect plan-centric approach
- **Documentation files**: Updated all references to use new command name
  - CLAUDE.md
  - plugin/README.md
  - plugin/QUICKSTART.md
  - plugin/templates/project/README.md
  - plugin/templates/project/CLAUDE.md

### Impact

This change clarifies the implementation workflow:
- Plans are the execution documents, specs are the requirements
- Command name now matches what it operates on (plan, not spec)
- Consistent with the pattern where plan references spec via `./SPEC.md`
- More intuitive for users: "implement the plan" vs "implement the spec"

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-11

### Changed

- **Directory structure**: Features now use date-based organization
  - Feature specs: `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/SPEC.md` (was: `specs/features/<feature-name>/SPEC.md`)
  - Implementation plans: `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/PLAN.md` (was: `specs/plans/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/PLAN.md`)
  - Plans now live alongside their specs in the same directory
  - Removed separate `specs/plans/` directory

### Updated Files

- **spec-writer agent**: Updated location rules with date-based feature paths
- **planner agent**: Plans now stored alongside specs (not in separate plans/ directory)
- **planning skill**: Updated plan location and template
- **spec-writing skill**: Updated spec locations table with date-based organization
- **new-feature command**: Creates dated feature directories and sets creation date
- **init-project command**: Removed `specs/plans/` from directory structure
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated examples and Important Files table

### Impact

This change provides better organization and traceability:
- Chronological organization of features by creation date
- Specs and plans kept together in one location
- Easier to find features by when they were created
- Cleaner directory structure (no separate plans directory)
- Relative paths in plans (./SPEC.md) instead of absolute paths

### Migration Guide

For existing projects using the old structure:
- Move `specs/features/<feature-name>/SPEC.md` to `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/SPEC.md`
- Move `specs/plans/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/PLAN.md` to `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/PLAN.md`
- Use the `created` date from the spec frontmatter for the YYYY/MM/DD directory
- Delete empty `specs/plans/` directory

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

- **/project:init-project command**: Completely redesigned with approval-based workflow
  - **Phase 1: Gather Information** - Prompts for project details before any file creation
    - Project name and description
    - Primary business domain
    - Tech stack confirmation
    - Component selection (Server, Webapp, Helm, Testing, CI/CD)
  - **Phase 2: Show Configuration Summary** - Displays complete plan with directory structure
  - **Phase 3: User Approval** - Explicitly asks for confirmation before creating any files
  - **Phase 4: Project Creation** - Only executes after user approval
  - Customizable component selection (choose which parts to include)
  - Template variable substitution for project name, description, and domain
  - Conditional directory/file creation based on selected components
  - More predictable and transparent initialization process

### Impact

This update transforms /project:init-project from an automatic file generator into an interactive, approval-based tool:
- No files created until user explicitly approves
- Users can customize which components to include
- Clear visibility into what will be created before it happens
- Follows same approval pattern as spec-writer and planner agents
- Better user experience with informed decision-making

- Centralized TypeScript standards in one location
- Centralized Testkube documentation in testing skill
- Improved consistency between backend and frontend development

## [1.1.2] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

- **CLAUDE.md**: Added strict version management workflow
  - Enforces required sequence: code changes → version bump → CHANGELOG update → commit
  - Prevents version bumps without corresponding CHANGELOG entries
  - Includes example workflow for clarity
  - Makes version management process explicit and mandatory

This ensures all version changes are properly documented before being committed.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

- **/project:implement-spec command**: Added comprehensive verification requirements
  - Mandatory full spec and plan review before starting implementation
  - Explicit requirement to read ENTIRE spec and plan documents
  - Create complete mental model before proceeding to implementation
  - Enhanced testing phase with mandatory test execution and pass requirements
  - 6-step final verification process (spec review, testing, functionality, code review, documentation, final report)
  - Clear directive to NOT declare implementation complete until all tests pass and all verification steps are finished
  - Prevents incomplete implementations and ensures thorough validation

### Added

- `.gitignore` file to exclude macOS `.DS_Store` files

This ensures the implement-spec command follows a rigorous, complete workflow that validates all requirements before declaring success.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added

- **Version management system**: Automatic version bumping across plugin files
  - Updates both `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
  - Added to CLAUDE.md instructions for consistency

### Enhanced

- **spec-writer agent**: Added explicit user approval requirements
  - Must get user approval before creating/modifying specifications
  - Prevents unwanted spec changes
- **planner agent**: Added explicit user approval requirements
  - Must get user approval before creating/modifying implementation plans
  - Ensures alignment before planning work

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-07

### Enhanced

- **backend-dev agent**: Added comprehensive OpenTelemetry guidelines
  - Structured logging with Pino and trace context injection
  - Required log fields and security rules
  - Standard metrics (HTTP, database, business operations)
  - OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for metric naming
  - Custom spans for business operations
  - Span attributes following OTel standards
  - Layer-specific telemetry responsibilities

This ensures all backend implementations follow OpenTelemetry best practices with consistent, observable code.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-07

### Enhanced

- **api-designer agent**: Added explicit requirement for `operationId` in camelCase for all endpoints
- **backend-dev agent**: Clarified that controller handler names must match OpenAPI `operationId` with `handle` prefix
- **Template OpenAPI spec**: Added comment showing operationId usage example

This ensures seamless coordination between API design and backend implementation, with clear naming conventions from contract to controller.
