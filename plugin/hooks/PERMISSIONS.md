# SDD Plugin Permissions Setup

SDD commands create and modify many files during project initialization and development. By default, Claude Code will prompt you to approve each file operation individually, which can be tedious.

This guide explains how to configure permissions to reduce prompts while maintaining security.

## Plugin Directory Access

The SDD plugin needs to read its own files (templates, skills, system code) during initialization and command execution. Add this permission to enable plugin file access:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Read(~/.claude/plugins/sdd/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

This permission allows Claude Code to read plugin templates, skills, and configuration files without prompting. You can configure this automatically using `/sdd-run permissions configure`.

## Automatic Hooks (Built-in)

The SDD plugin includes hooks that automatically manage file operations:

### PreToolUse Hook: Write Validation
- **Auto-approves** writes to safe SDD directories (`specs/`, `components/`, `config/`, etc.)
- **Blocks** writes to sensitive paths (`.env`, `secrets/`, `.git/`, etc.)

### PostToolUse Hook: Commit Reminders
- **Prompts to commit** after any write to SDD-managed directories
- Ensures no file changes are ever lost due to uncommitted work
- Covers: `changes/`, `specs/`, `components/`, `config/`, `tests/`

Both hooks are registered automatically when the plugin is installed. No manual configuration required.

**Requirement:** The hook requires `jq` to be installed:
```bash
# macOS
brew install jq

# Ubuntu/Debian
apt-get install jq
```

## Additional Permission Configuration (Optional)

For even fewer prompts, you can add static permission patterns to your project's `.claude/settings.local.json`.

### Option 1: Minimal Permissions (Recommended)

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Write(specs/**)",
      "Write(components/**)",
      "Write(config/**)",
      "Edit(specs/**)",
      "Edit(components/**)",
      "Edit(config/**)",
      "Bash(git *)",
      "Bash(npm *)",
      "Bash(mkdir -p:*)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Write(.env*)",
      "Write(**/secrets/**)",
      "Edit(.env*)",
      "Edit(**/secrets/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Full SDD Permissions

For the complete recommended permission set, copy from:
```
plugin/hooks/recommended-permissions.json
```

### Option 3: Maximum Convenience (Development Only)

For local development where you trust all operations:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Write",
      "Edit",
      "Bash"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Write(.env*)",
      "Edit(.env*)",
      "Bash(rm -rf *)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Warning:** This grants broad permissions. Only use in trusted development environments.

## Understanding SDD File Operations

### What SDD Commands Write

| Command | Files Created/Modified |
|---------|----------------------|
| `/sdd-init` | ~50+ files: project structure, specs, components, config |
| `/sdd-change new` | 2-3 files: SPEC.md, workflow.yaml, INDEX.md |
| `/sdd-change approve spec` | 1-2 files: PLAN.md, workflow.yaml |
| `/sdd-change implement` | Many files: implementation code, tests, docs |
| `/sdd-change verify` | None (read-only verification) |

### Safe Directories (Auto-Approved by Hook)

These directories contain SDD-managed content:

- `specs/` - Specifications, plans, domain definitions
- `components/` - Generated component code
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD definitions
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `tests/` - Test files

### Protected Paths (Blocked by Hook)

These are always blocked:

- `.env*` - Environment variables with secrets
- `secrets/` - Sensitive credentials
- `.git/` - Git internals
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (should use npm)
- `credentials` - Credential files
- `*.pem`, `*.key` - Private keys
- `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519` - SSH keys

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Many Prompts?

1. **Check jq is installed**: `which jq`
2. **Check plugin is enabled**: `claude plugins list`
3. **Add static permissions**: Use Option 1 above for additional coverage

### Hook Not Working?

1. **Check jq is installed**: `which jq`
2. **Test validation hook manually**:
   ```bash
   echo '{"tool":"Write","tool_input":{"file_path":"specs/test.md"}}' | ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/validate-sdd-writes.sh
   ```
3. **Test commit prompt hook manually**:
   ```bash
   echo '{"tool":"Write","tool_input":{"file_path":"components/backend/src/index.ts"}}' | ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/prompt-commit-after-write.sh
   ```
4. **Check plugin version**: Ensure you have v4.6.0+ which includes the hooks

### Too Many Commit Reminders?

The commit prompt hook fires after every write to SDD-managed directories. If this is too frequent:

1. **Batch your changes** - Make multiple related edits before committing
2. **Disable the hook** - Remove the `PostToolUse` section from `plugin/hooks/hooks.json`

Note: Disabling the hook means you must remember to commit manually to prevent data loss.

### Permission Denied Unexpectedly?

The hook blocks paths containing:
- `.env`
- `secrets/`
- `.git/`
- `node_modules/`
- `credentials`
- `*.pem`, `*.key`
- `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`

If you need to write to a blocked path, you'll need to approve it manually (this is intentional for security).

## Security Considerations

1. **Sensitive files always prompt** - `.env`, secrets, keys require manual approval
2. **Review deny rules** - Ensure sensitive paths are blocked
3. **Project-level settings** - Use `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) for permissions
4. **The hook is conservative** - Unknown paths pass through to normal Claude Code flow
