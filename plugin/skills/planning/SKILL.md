# Planning Skill

## Plan Location

Plans are stored alongside their specs:

`changes/YYYY/MM/DD/<workflow-id>/<NN-change-name>/PLAN.md`

This keeps all change documentation (spec + plan) together in one location.

## Workflow Integration

Plans are created as part of the `/sdd-change` workflow:

1. User creates or imports a change via `/sdd-change new`
2. Spec solicitation creates SPEC.md
3. User reviews and approves spec via `/sdd-change approve spec <change-id>`
4. **This skill creates PLAN.md** immediately after spec approval
5. User reviews and approves plan via `/sdd-change approve plan <change-id>`
6. Implementation can begin via `/sdd-change implement <change-id>`

**Plan creation is triggered by spec approval**, not by separate command.

### Input from workflow-state

When invoked, this skill receives:
- `change_id`: The workflow-scoped change ID (e.g., `a1b2-1`)
- `spec_path`: Path to the approved SPEC.md
- `workflow_id`: Workflow ID for context

### Output to workflow-state

After plan creation:
- PLAN.md saved via `workflow_state.save_plan()`
- Status updated to `plan_review`
- Checkpoint commit created

## SPEC.md vs PLAN.md Separation

| File | Purpose | Contains | Does NOT Contain |
|------|---------|----------|------------------|
| **SPEC.md** | What to build and how | Requirements, design, API contracts, implementation details, test cases | Execution order, agent assignments |
| **PLAN.md** | Execution coordination | Phases, agent assignments, dependencies, expected files, progress tracking | Implementation details, code patterns, specific coding tasks |

> **Key principle:** Because plans focus on execution coordination (not implementation details), the SPEC.md must be comprehensive enough that an implementer can complete each phase by reading only the spec. Plans reference specs; they don't duplicate them.

### Plan Content Guidelines

**Acceptable in plans:**
- Brief code snippets as constraints or guidelines (e.g., "interface must include X field")
- High-level examples showing intent
- File paths and component names
- Phase sequencing and dependencies
- Extensive test lists (tests define WHAT, not HOW)

**Not appropriate in plans:**
- Full implementations or complete code blocks
- Step-by-step coding instructions
- Line-by-line change lists
- Algorithm implementations (belong in spec)

### SPEC.md: Thorough Technical Specification

SPEC.md is a **complete technical specification**. It must be:

- **Self-sufficient**: Anyone reading the spec understands the change fully without other docs
- **Thorough**: Covers all aspects (functional, non-functional, security, errors, observability)
- **Technical**: Includes schemas, algorithms, data models, API contracts
- **Testable**: Every requirement has clear acceptance criteria

Key sections:
- Background and current state (context)
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Technical design (architecture, data model, algorithms)
- API contracts with request/response schemas
- Security considerations
- Error handling strategy
- Observability (logging, metrics, traces)
- Testing strategy with specific test cases
- Domain updates (glossary, definitions)
- Dependencies and migration plan

### Domain Documentation in Specs

Domain documentation is specified **in SPEC.md during planning**, not discovered during implementation.

The SPEC.md file includes a `## Domain Updates` section that explicitly lists:
- **Glossary Terms** - exact terms to add/modify in `specs/domain/glossary.md`
- **Definition Specs** - domain definition files to create/update in `specs/domain/definitions/`
- **Architecture Docs** - updates needed in `specs/architecture/`

### Testing Strategy in Specs

The SPEC.md file includes a `## Testing Strategy` section that defines:
- **Unit Tests** - what behaviors need unit tests (implemented via TDD during execution)
- **Integration Tests** - what integrations need testing
- **E2E Tests** - what user flows need end-to-end tests

This approach ensures:
1. All requirements (domain, tests, verification) are fully understood before implementation
2. Implementation simply executes the specified updates (no discovery)
3. Clear traceability from spec to implementation

## Dynamic Phase Generation

Plans are generated dynamically based on the SPEC.md's Components section.

### Component Source of Truth

**SPEC.md is the source of truth for required components.**

The planning skill:
1. Reads the `## Components` section from SPEC.md
2. May reference `.sdd/sdd-settings.yaml` for existing component details
3. Does NOT ask about tech stack or which components to use

If SPEC.md says a component is needed but it's not in `sdd-settings.yaml` yet, that's expected - the component will be created during implementation.

**DO NOT ask tech stack questions during planning.** Component discovery already determined what's needed.

### Generation Algorithm

1. **Read required components** from SPEC.md `## Components` section
2. **Reference existing components** from `.sdd/sdd-settings.yaml` for details
3. **Order by dependency graph:**
   ```
   config ──────┐
                │
   contract ────┼──→ server (includes DB) ──→ helm
                │           │
                │           ↓
                └───────→ webapp
   ```
4. **Assign agents** based on component + change nature:

| Component | Primary Agent | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| contract | api-designer | API design and OpenAPI updates |
| server | backend-dev | Backend implementation + DB (TDD) |
| webapp | frontend-dev | Frontend implementation (TDD) |
| helm | devops | Deployment and infrastructure |
| config | contextual | backend-dev, frontend-dev, or devops based on what config affects |

5. **Add final phases:**
   - `tester` for integration/E2E testing
   - `reviewer` (+ `db-advisor` if DB changes)

### Testing Strategy

| Test Type | When | Agent |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Unit tests | During implementation (TDD) | backend-dev, frontend-dev |
| Integration tests | After all implementation phases | tester |
| E2E tests | After all implementation phases | tester |

## Phase Structure

- Each phase is independently reviewable
- Domain updates execute first (from SPEC.md)
- Component phases follow dependency order
- Phases build on each other sequentially

## Implementation State Tracking

Plans include sections for tracking implementation progress:

### Expected Files
- **Files to Create** - new files this change will add
- **Files to Modify** - existing files this change will update

### Implementation State
- **Current Phase** - which phase is in progress
- **Status** - pending, in_progress, blocked, complete
- **Completed Phases** - checklist of completed phases
- **Actual Files Changed** - updated during implementation with real files
- **Blockers** - any issues blocking progress
- **Resource Usage** - tokens (input/output), turns, and duration per phase

This enables:
1. Session resumption from any point
2. Audit trail of what actually changed
3. Progress visibility for stakeholders
4. Resource usage analysis (cost and time estimation for similar changes)

## PR Size Guidelines

Each phase should result in a reviewable PR:

| Metric | Target | Maximum |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Lines changed | < 400 | 800 |
| Files changed | < 15 | 30 |
| Acceptance criteria | < 5 | 8 |

**If a phase exceeds limits:**
1. Split into sub-phases (e.g., Phase 2a, Phase 2b)
2. Each sub-phase gets its own PR
3. Document splits in plan

## Epic Plans

For `type: epic` changes, use the `epic-planning` skill. Epics contain multiple feature-type changes in a `changes/` subdirectory, each with its own SPEC.md and PLAN.md.
