Using the postgresql skill, create a migration to add a phone column to the users table.

The users table already exists with columns: id, email, name, created_at, updated_at

Migration requirements:
- Add a new column: phone VARCHAR(20), nullable
- Add an index on the phone column (use CONCURRENTLY if possible)
- Follow safe migration patterns from the postgresql skill

Create the migration file at: db/migrations/002_add_user_phone.sql

IMPORTANT:
- Follow the postgresql skill's schema-management reference for safe migrations
- Add column as nullable first (this is safe and fast)
- Use CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY if the migration supports it
- The SQL must be executable via psql
