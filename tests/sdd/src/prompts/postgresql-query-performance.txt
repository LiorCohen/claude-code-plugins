Using the postgresql skill, analyze query performance on the orders table.

The orders table exists with columns: id, user_id, total, created_at
It has approximately 1000 rows of data.

Tasks:
1. Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on a query that finds orders for a specific user_id
2. Identify if the query is doing a sequential scan
3. Suggest an index to improve performance
4. Show what the query plan would look like with the index

Connect to the database using:
- Container: sdd-postgres-test
- User: testuser
- Database: testdb
- Use: docker exec sdd-postgres-test psql -U testuser -d testdb -c "..."

IMPORTANT:
- Follow the postgresql skill's performance-tuning reference
- Use EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) for detailed output
- Show the actual execution time in results
