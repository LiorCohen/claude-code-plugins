Using the postgresql skill, create a backup script for the database.

Requirements:
- Create a shell script that backs up the database using pg_dump
- Use custom format (-Fc) for the backup
- Include a timestamp in the backup filename
- Store backups in a ./backups directory
- Add basic error handling

Create the script at: scripts/backup.sh

Database connection info for reference:
- Host: localhost
- Port: 5432
- User: app_user
- Database: myapp

IMPORTANT:
- Follow the postgresql skill's deployment reference for pg_dump usage
- Make the script executable-ready (proper shebang, etc.)
- Include comments explaining what each section does
