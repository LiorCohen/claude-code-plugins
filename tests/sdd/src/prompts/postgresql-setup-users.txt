Using the postgresql skill, create database roles and users with appropriate permissions.

Create the following:
1. A role named "app_readonly" with SELECT permissions
2. A role named "app_readwrite" with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE permissions
3. A user named "app_service" with password 'service_pass' that has the app_readwrite role
4. Set default privileges so future tables automatically grant to these roles

Create the SQL file at: db/permissions/setup_roles.sql

IMPORTANT:
- Follow the postgresql skill's permissions-setup reference
- Use proper GRANT statements
- Include ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES for future objects
- The SQL must be executable via psql
