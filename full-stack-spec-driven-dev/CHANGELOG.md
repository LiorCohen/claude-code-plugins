  - Added Config to "Frontend Only" project type
  - Changed Config dependency from "Server" to "-" (no dependencies)
  - Updated validation rules: Config is always auto-included
  - Config directory and files are now created in "Always create" section

## [2.0.4] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed

- **Helm and Config component dependencies**: Corrected to require Server only
  - Helm requires Server (Kubernetes deployment is for backend services)
  - Config requires Server (frontend config is handled differently)
  - Removed "or Webapp" from Helm and Config dependencies

## [2.0.3] - 2026-01-19

### Changed

- **sdd-init component selection with dependencies**
  - Replaced flat component list with project type options:
    - **Full-Stack Application**: Contract, Server, Webapp, Config, Testing, CI/CD
    - **Backend API Only**: Contract, Server, Config, Testing, CI/CD
    - **Frontend Only**: Webapp, Testing, CI/CD
    - **Custom**: Manual selection with dependency validation
  - Added component dependency table (e.g., Contract requires Server, Helm requires Server)
  - Added validation rules to prevent invalid combinations
  - Contract is no longer "always included" - only with Server
  - Integrated Config component into sdd-init workflow

## [2.0.2] - 2026-01-19

### Added

- **`sdd_version` field required in all specs and plans**
  - Added to frontmatter requirements in `spec-writing` skill
  - Added to plan template in `planning` skill
  - Updated `spec-writer` agent to include version requirement
  - Updated `planner` agent to include version in generated plans
  - Updated `sdd-new-feature` command to read and inject plugin version
  - Updated `sdd-init` command to include version in imported specs

### Rationale

Tracking the SDD plugin version in specs and plans enables:
- **Compatibility tracking**: Know which plugin version generated a spec
- **Migration support**: Identify specs that may need updating after plugin changes
- **Debugging**: Trace issues to specific plugin versions

## [2.0.1] - 2026-01-19

### Added

- **Config component template** (`templates/components/config/`)
  - JSON Schema for configuration validation (`schemas/schema.json`)
  - Separate schemas for ops config (`ops-schema.json`) and app config (`app-schema.json`)
  - Environment-specific YAML configs: `config.yaml` (base), `config-local.yaml`, `config-testing.yaml`, `config-production.yaml`
  - Ops config covers: server, database, logging, telemetry
  - App config is extensible per project (no predefined semantics)

**Note:** This component is not yet active. Missing:
- Agent for config management
- Skill for config validation
- Integration with sdd-init command

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-19

### Breaking Changes

- **Renamed Server layer to App layer** in backend 5-layer architecture
  - `src/server/` directory → `src/app/`
  - `createServer` function → `createApp`
  - `Server` type → `App` type
  - Updated all references in backend-dev agent
  - Updated sdd-init command directory creation and file copy paths
  - Updated template files with new naming

### Migration Guide

For existing projects using the 1.x structure:
1. Rename `src/server/` directory to `src/app/`
2. Rename `create_server.ts` to `create_app.ts`
3. Update function name `createServer` → `createApp`
4. Update type names `Server` → `App`, `ServerDependencies` → `AppDependencies`
5. Update imports in `src/index.ts`: `import { createApp } from './app'`

### Rationale

The "Server" layer name was confusing because it conflicted with the "server" component name (`components/server`). Renaming to "App" provides:
- **Clarity**: Clear distinction between the component (`components/server`) and the layer (`src/app/`)
- **Consistency**: App layer creates and manages the application lifecycle
- **Semantic accuracy**: The layer handles more than just HTTP server concerns (middleware, routes, graceful shutdown, database connections)

## [1.10.29] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- **TDD Red-Green-Refactor methodology** to backend-dev agent
  - The Cycle: RED (failing test) → GREEN (minimal code) → REFACTOR
  - TDD by Layer table: test locations for Model, DAL, Controller, Server
  - TDD Rules: file naming, fake dependencies, behavior-focused tests
  - Updated Build Order to integrate RED/GREEN steps

## [1.10.28] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed

- **QUICKSTART.md installation commands**: Use correct Claude Code plugin syntax
  - Step 1: `/plugin marketplace add LiorCohen/claude-code-plugins`
  - Step 2: `/plugin install sdd@lior-cohen-cc-plugins`

## [1.10.27] - 2026-01-18

### Changed

- **QUICKSTART.md installation steps**: Split into two clear steps
  - Step 1: Install the marketplace (`claude mcp add-json`)
  - Step 2: Install the SDD plugin from marketplace (`claude plugin install sdd --marketplace`)

## [1.10.26] - 2026-01-18

### Changed

- **Server layer owns DB connections**: Clarified database connection handling
  - Server layer creates connection pool on startup using Config values
  - Passes database client to Controller (which passes to DAL via Dependencies)
  - Closes connections on graceful shutdown

## [1.10.25] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- **Controller http_handlers structure**: Clarified controller layer organization
  - Added `http_handlers/` directory with one file per API namespace
  - Each handler file exports a router (e.g., `usersRouter`)
  - `create_controller.ts` assembles routers and creates Dependencies for Model
  - Added template files: `http_handlers/users.ts`, `http_handlers/index.ts`
  - Updated `create_controller.ts` to use the new structure

## [1.10.24] - 2026-01-18

### Changed

- **Refined backend-dev.md**: Keep explanations, remove inline code examples (305 lines)
  - Preserved all verbal explanations, rules, and guidelines
  - Removed inline code examples (now in template files)
  - Each layer section points to its template for code patterns
  - Kept directory structure diagrams (not code)
  - Kept all tables (log levels, metrics, span attributes, etc.)

## [1.10.23] - 2026-01-18

### Changed

- **Restored backend-dev.md explanatory content**: Reverted over-consolidation that removed essential guidance
  - Restored detailed layer explanations with code examples
  - Restored Definitions Rules (TypeScript types only, no Zod)
  - Restored Use Case Pattern and DAL Function Pattern examples
  - Restored complete Telemetry section (logging, metrics, spans)
  - Added template references to each layer section while preserving explanations
  - File now 680 lines with full guidance + template references

## [1.10.22] - 2026-01-18

### Changed

- **Consolidated backend-dev.md**: Reduced from 663 to 142 lines by removing redundancies
  - Merged Templates table and Layer Overview into single Architecture table
  - Replaced inline code examples with template file references
  - Removed redundant TypeScript Standards section (now references `typescript-standards` skill)
  - Consolidated duplicate environment variable rules
  - Simplified Telemetry section with table format

## [1.10.21] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- **Server templates**: Added comprehensive template files for all 5 backend layers
  - `model/` - definitions, dependencies, use-cases with example user CRUD
  - `dal/` - data access functions (find_user_by_id, find_user_by_email, insert_user)
  - `controller/` - request/response handling with health check endpoints
  - `telemetry/` - OpenTelemetry logging and metrics setup
  - Updated `index.ts` to import telemetry first

## [1.10.20] - 2026-01-18

### Removed

- **Debug banners**: Removed banner printing instructions from all agents and skills
  - Removed from 10 agents: api-designer, backend-dev, ci-dev, db-advisor, devops, frontend-dev, planner, reviewer, spec-writer, tester
  - Removed from 5 SDD skills: planning, spec-index, spec-writing, testing, typescript-standards
  - Removed from marketplace commit skill

## [1.10.19] - 2026-01-17

### Changed

- **Refactored MVVM architecture**: Moved models from root-level directory to page-specific files
  - Removed `src/models/` directory from frontend structure
  - Each page now contains its own model file (e.g., `user_profile_model.ts`)
  - Models contain page-specific business logic (data transformation, validation, domain rules)
  - Services (`src/services/`) remain shared for API communication
  - Updated Page Structure example to show model file usage with ViewModel integration

### Rationale

Page-specific models provide:
- **Colocation**: Business logic lives alongside its View and ViewModel
- **Clarity**: Each page's model contains only relevant logic
- **Simplicity**: No need for a shared models directory with unclear ownership
- **Consistency**: Follows the same pattern as page-specific ViewModels

## [1.10.18] - 2026-01-17

### Changed

- **Simplified plugin.json**: Removed explicit commands, agents, and skills arrays - Claude Code auto-discovers these from directory structure

## [1.10.17] - 2026-01-17

### Added

- **Explicit agents and skills paths in plugin.json**: Added `agents` and `skills` directory references to plugin manifest for better plugin discovery

## [1.10.16] - 2026-01-17

### Changed

- **Reorganized skills into dedicated folders**: Each skill now has its own directory
  - `skills/<skill-name>.md` → `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
  - Prepares for skills to have additional resources (templates, examples)

## [1.10.15] - 2026-01-17

### Added

- **Debug banners for agents and skills**: All agents and skills now print a colorful banner when invoked
  - Agents display: `🤖 AGENT: <name>` with description
  - Skills display: `🔧 SKILL: <name>` with description
  - Helps identify which agents/skills are active during command execution

## [1.10.14] - 2026-01-17

### Changed

- **Renamed commands from `/project:<command>` to `/sdd-<command>`**: Updated all command references
  - `/project:init` → `/sdd-init`
  - `/project:new-feature` → `/sdd-new-feature`
  - `/project:implement-plan` → `/sdd-implement-plan`
  - `/project:verify-spec` → `/sdd-verify-spec`
  - `/project:generate-snapshot` → `/sdd-generate-snapshot`
  - Updated command files and project templates

## [1.10.13] - 2026-01-17

### Changed

- **Extracted inline templates to templates/ directory**: Code templates now live in separate files
  - Server templates: `src/index.ts`, `src/config/load_config.ts`, `src/config/index.ts`, `src/server/create_server.ts`, `src/server/index.ts`, `.gitignore`
  - Webapp templates: `src/main.tsx`, `src/app.tsx`, `src/index.css`, `.gitignore`
  - sdd-init.md now references template files instead of inline code blocks
  - Renamed `App.tsx` to `app.tsx` to follow lowercase naming convention

### Rationale

Extracting templates to separate files provides:
- **Maintainability**: Templates can be edited as real TypeScript files with IDE support
- **Testability**: Template files can be validated independently
- **Clarity**: sdd-init.md is more concise and easier to read

## [1.10.12] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed

- **Moved `dotenv.config()` inside `loadConfig()` function**: Fixed side effect on import
  - `dotenv.config()` is now called inside `loadConfig()`, not at module level
  - Config module has no side effects when imported
  - Only `src/index.ts` has side effects (application entry point)
  - Updated both `backend-dev` agent and `sdd-init` command

- **Changed `interface` to `type` in code templates**: Consistency with typescript-standards
  - Config and Server types now use `type` with `Readonly<>` wrapper
  - Follows the pattern shown in typescript-standards examples

- **Clarified entry point exception**: `src/index.ts` is allowed to have side effects as application entry point
  - This is an explicit exception to the "index.ts exports only" rule
  - Application entry points need to run code on import

- **Moved logic out of module index.ts files**: All index.ts files now contain only exports
  - `src/config/load_config.ts` contains the `loadConfig` function and `Config` type
  - `src/config/index.ts` re-exports from `load_config.ts`
  - `src/server/create_server.ts` contains the `createServer` function
  - `src/server/index.ts` re-exports from `create_server.ts`
  - Updated both `backend-dev` agent and `sdd-init` command

### Rationale

These fixes ensure all code templates follow the established standards:
- **Testability**: Modules can be imported in tests without triggering side effects (except entry point)
- **Standards compliance**: All `index.ts` files contain only exports (except application entry point)

## [1.10.11] - 2026-01-17

### Removed

- **sdd-init command**: Removed tech stack confirmation prompt
  - The tech stack is fixed (React, Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes)
  - No need to ask for confirmation since it cannot be changed during init
  - Streamlines the initialization flow

## [1.10.10] - 2026-01-17

### Changed

- **sdd-init command**: Changed argument syntax from positional to named
  - Project name now uses `--name <project-name>` instead of positional argument
  - Examples updated: `/sdd-init --name my-app` instead of `/sdd-init my-app`
  - Consistent with `--spec` argument style

### Rationale

Named arguments provide:
- **Clarity**: Explicit intent when specifying project name
- **Consistency**: Both arguments now use `--` prefix style
- **Flexibility**: Arguments can be provided in any order

## [1.10.9] - 2026-01-16

### Enhanced

- **sdd-init command**: Now follows `backend-dev` agent and `typescript-standards` skill when generating code
  - Added CRITICAL note requiring all generated code to follow agent/skill standards
  - Server component: Generates proper 5-layer architecture scaffolding
    - Minimal `src/index.ts` entry point (only file with side effects)
    - `src/config/index.ts` with dotenv and type-safe config
    - `src/server/index.ts` with server factory pattern
  - Webapp component: Generates MVVM architecture scaffolding
    - Creates full MVVM directory structure (`pages/`, `components/`, `viewmodels/`, `models/`, `services/`, `stores/`, `types/`, `utils/`)
    - `src/main.tsx` entry point
    - `src/App.tsx` with TailwindCSS
    - `src/index.css` with Tailwind directives
    - Tailwind config file
  - All generated TypeScript follows `typescript-standards` (readonly, arrow functions, named exports)

### Rationale

Ensuring sdd-init follows the same standards as implementation:
- **Consistency**: Initial scaffolding matches what implementation phases produce
- **No refactoring needed**: Developers don't need to restructure after init
- **Learning**: New developers see correct patterns from the start
- **Standards enforcement**: Agent/skill rules apply from day one

## [1.10.8] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- **planning skill**: Added Phase 0 (Domain Documentation) as mandatory prerequisite
  - Phase 0 MUST be completed before any code implementation begins
  - Tasks: Update glossary, create/update definition specs, document use cases, update architecture docs
  - Includes verification checklist to ensure all domain concepts are documented
  - Phases renumbered: Domain Documentation (0) → API Contract (1) → Backend (2) → Frontend (3) → Testing (4) → Review (5)

- **sdd-implement-plan command**: Updated to explicitly reference Phase 0
  - Step 2 now titled "Execute Phase 0: Domain Documentation"
  - Clear blocking requirement: Cannot proceed to Phase 1 until Phase 0 is complete
  - Updated example to show Phase 0 execution flow

### Rationale

Domain documentation as a prerequisite ensures:
- **Shared understanding**: All domain concepts documented before implementation
- **No drift**: Code implementation follows documented domain model
- **Traceability**: Clear path from spec → domain docs → implementation
- **Quality**: Forces thinking through domain model before writing code

## [1.10.7] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- **backend-dev agent**: Entry point rules for `src/index.ts`
  - `src/index.ts` is the ONLY file with side effects when imported
  - All other files must be pure exports with no side effects on import
  - `src/index.ts` must be minimal: import server, start server, nothing else
  - NO logic, configuration loading, or setup in the root index file
  - Added code example showing the correct minimal entry point pattern
  - Added corresponding rule to Rules section

### Rationale

Isolating side effects to `src/index.ts` provides:
- **Testability**: All modules can be imported in tests without triggering side effects
- **Clarity**: Easy to understand what runs at startup vs what's pure code
- **Modularity**: Each module is self-contained and doesn't depend on import order
- **Debugging**: Side effects are predictable and traceable to one location

## [1.10.6] - 2026-01-16

### Changed

- **Terminology clarification**: "Model" always refers to Domain Model layer, never database models
  - Updated `frontend-dev` agent: `src/models/` description changed from "Business logic and data models" to "Domain logic (the 'M' in MVVM)"
  - Updated `README.md`: Same clarification for frontend directory structure
  - Updated `planning.md` skill: Backend tasks now specify "Add domain definitions to `model/definitions/`" instead of ambiguous "Add model definitions"
  - Updated historical CHANGELOG entry for v1.7.0 to use consistent terminology

### Rationale

The term "Model" in this plugin exclusively refers to:
- **Backend**: The Model layer containing domain definitions and use-cases (`src/model/`)
- **Frontend**: The Model layer in MVVM containing domain/business logic (`src/models/`)

The term "data model" was removed as it could be confused with database models. This plugin does not use "Model" to refer to database-related concepts.

## [1.10.5] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- **typescript-standards skill**: Added "No Classes or Inheritance" rule
  - CRITICAL: Never use classes or inheritance unless creating a subclass of Error
  - Classes encourage mutation and tight coupling
  - Inheritance creates fragile hierarchies
  - Functions with explicit dependencies are easier to test and reason about
  - Error subclasses are the only exception (for `instanceof` checks and stack traces)
  - Added code examples showing correct patterns (types + functions) vs incorrect (classes, inheritance, service classes)
  - Updated Summary Checklist with new rule

### Rationale

Avoiding classes and inheritance provides:
- **Immutability**: Functions don't have `this` to mutate
- **Simplicity**: No inheritance hierarchies to navigate
- **Testability**: Pure functions with explicit dependencies are trivial to test
- **Clarity**: Data flows through function parameters, not hidden state

## [1.10.4] - 2026-01-15

### Changed

- **backend-dev agent**: Model definitions must use TypeScript types only
  - NO Zod, Yup, io-ts, or similar validation libraries in `model/definitions/`
  - Definitions are compile-time type constructs, not runtime validators
  - Validation belongs in Controller layer (input) or Server layer (middleware)
  - Added code examples showing correct TypeScript types vs incorrect Zod usage

### Rationale

Keeping model definitions as pure TypeScript types:
- **Separation of concerns**: Validation is an infrastructure concern, not domain logic
- **Simplicity**: Types are sufficient for domain modeling
- **No runtime overhead**: Compile-time checks only
- **Cleaner imports**: Model layer stays dependency-free

## [1.10.3] - 2026-01-15

### Enhanced

- **backend-dev agent**: Added explicit info logging guidelines for telemetry
  - Log **before** starting a domain action (`info`)
  - Log **after** success (`info`) or failure (`error`)
  - Applies to: database writes, user actions, outgoing calls, state transitions, business events
  - Added code examples showing proper before/after logging pattern

### Rationale

Consistent info logging enables:
- **Observability**: Track all significant operations in production
- **Debugging**: Trace the path of requests through the system
- **Auditing**: Record business-relevant events for compliance
- **Monitoring**: Alert on missing expected logs

## [1.10.2] - 2026-01-15

### Changed

- **Terminology update**: Renamed `entities` to `definitions` throughout the plugin
  - `specs/domain/entities/` → `specs/domain/definitions/`
  - Updated all agents, skills, commands, and templates
  - Updated README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and documentation
  - Affects: spec-writer agent, spec-writing skill, planning skill, sdd-init command, sdd-implement-plan command, sdd-verify-spec command, glossary template

### Rationale

The term "definitions" is more generic and inclusive:
- **Broader scope**: Covers entities, value objects, aggregates, and other domain concepts
- **Less prescriptive**: Doesn't impose DDD terminology on projects
- **Clearer intent**: "Definitions" better describes the purpose of documenting domain concepts

## [1.10.1] - 2026-01-15

### Changed

- **backend-dev agent**: Replaced repository pattern with data access functions in DAL layer
  - One function per file, named after the function (e.g., `find_user_by_id.ts`)
  - Each function receives its dependencies as the first argument
  - No classes, repository interfaces, or abstraction layers
  - Direct database queries with proper parameterization
  - `index.ts` re-exports all functions
  - No assumed grouping - subdirectories only if explicitly instructed

### Rationale

Data access functions provide:
- **Simplicity**: Direct, focused functions without abstraction overhead
- **Flexibility**: Functions can query across multiple tables without definition-based constraints
- **Clarity**: Each file does one thing, named after what it does
- **No assumptions**: Developer controls structure, no forced definition grouping

## [1.10.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- **specs/domain/use-cases/ directory**: New directory for business use case definitions
  - Added to sdd-init command directory creation
  - Documented in README "Key Files in specs/" table
  - Documented in QUICKSTART "Key Files" table
  - Added to spec-writer agent Location Rules table
  - Use cases provide a structured location for documenting key business workflows and scenarios

### Rationale

The use-cases directory provides:
- **Structured Documentation**: Dedicated location for business workflows and scenarios
- **Domain Clarity**: Separates use cases from definitions and glossary for better organization
- **Spec Coverage**: Ensures business logic and user journeys are explicitly documented
- **Consistency**: Follows the same domain-driven structure as definitions and glossary

**Version Note**: This is a minor version bump (1.9.x → 1.10.0) because it adds a new feature (directory structure) that extends functionality without breaking existing behavior.

## [1.9.3] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- **sdd-init command smart directory handling**: Prevent redundant nested directories
  - Checks if current directory basename matches the project name
  - If in an empty directory with matching name, asks to initialize in place
  - Avoids creating `test-app/test-app/*` when already in `test-app/`
  - Uses `TARGET_DIR` variable throughout to handle both cases (current dir or subdirectory)
  - Updates completion messages to show actual location
  - Adjusts `cd` instructions based on whether a subdirectory was created
  - Git initialization checks if already in a repository

### Rationale

Smart directory detection provides:
- **Better UX**: No redundant nested directories when already in the right place
- **Flexibility**: Supports both "create subdirectory" and "initialize here" workflows
- **Safety**: Checks if directory is empty before initializing in place
- **Clarity**: Always shows absolute path in completion message

## [1.9.2] - 2026-01-13

### Enhanced

- **External spec handling in sdd-init command**: Improved external spec integration
  - External specs are now copied to `specs/external/<original-filename>` for permanent reference
  - Feature specs reference the external source via `external_source` frontmatter field
  - Added "External Source" section to feature specs with reference to original file
  - INDEX.md now includes an "External Specifications" section listing all imported specs
  - Directory structure includes `specs/external/` for preserving original source documents
  - Completion messages show the location of both the original and integrated specs
  - This provides better traceability between the original requirements and the SDD feature specs

### Rationale

Copying external specs to `specs/external/` and referencing them provides:
- **Traceability**: Clear link between original requirements and feature specs
- **Version control**: Original specs are preserved in git alongside the project
- **Auditability**: Easy to compare original requirements with implementation
- **Documentation**: Keeps all relevant documentation in one repository

## [1.9.1] - 2026-01-13

### Enhanced

- **File naming conventions enforced**: All agents now enforce `lowercase_with_underscores` for filenames
  - `frontend-dev` agent: Updated all examples and added explicit file naming rules
    - Directory names: `home_page/`, `user_profile/`, `button/` (not `HomePage/`, `UserProfile/`, `Button/`)
    - Component files: `user_profile.tsx`, `button.tsx` (not `UserProfile.tsx`, `Button.tsx`)
    - ViewModel hooks: `use_user_profile_view_model.ts` (not `useUserProfileViewModel.ts`)
    - Store files: `auth_store.ts` (not `authStore.ts`)
  - `backend-dev` agent: Updated use-case examples and added explicit file naming rules
    - Use-case files: `create_user.ts`, `update_user.ts` (not `createUser.ts`, `updateUser.ts`)
  - `api-designer` agent: Added file naming rule for schema files (already using correct convention)
  - Added clear examples with ✅ correct and ❌ incorrect patterns
  - Component names in code remain PascalCase (e.g., `export const UserProfile = ...`)

### Rationale

Lowercase_with_underscores provides:
- **Consistency**: Same convention across frontend, backend, and infrastructure files
- **Portability**: No case-sensitivity issues across operating systems
- **Readability**: Clear word separation without relying on case
- **Best practice**: Common convention in Python, SQL, and many infrastructure tools

## [1.9.0] - 2026-01-13

### Changed

- **All commands renamed**: Removed `project:` namespace, added `sdd-` prefix to all command names
  - `/project:init` → `/sdd-init`
  - `/project:new-feature` → `/sdd-new-feature`
  - `/project:implement-plan` → `/sdd-implement-plan`
  - `/project:verify-spec` → `/sdd-verify-spec`
  - `/project:generate-snapshot` → `/sdd-generate-snapshot`
  - Command files renamed with `sdd-` prefix (e.g., `init.md` → `sdd-init.md`)
  - Frontmatter `name` field updated in all command files
  - Heading updated in all command files (e.g., `# /project:init` → `# /sdd-init`)

### Updated Files

- `commands/sdd-init.md`: Renamed from `init.md`, updated name and heading
- `commands/sdd-new-feature.md`: Renamed from `new-feature.md`, updated name and heading
- `commands/sdd-implement-plan.md`: Renamed from `implement-plan.md`, updated name and heading
- `commands/sdd-verify-spec.md`: Renamed from `verify-spec.md`, updated name and heading
- `commands/sdd-generate-snapshot.md`: Renamed from `generate-snapshot.md`, updated name and heading
- `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: Updated commands array, bumped to 1.9.0
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`: Bumped to 1.9.0

### Impact

This change simplifies command naming and removes the redundant namespace:
- **Shorter commands**: Removed `project:` namespace (was redundant with plugin name)
- **Clearer naming**: `sdd-` prefix clearly identifies commands as part of SDD plugin
- **Consistency**: Command file names now match command names exactly
- **Better discoverability**: Commands are more intuitive with plugin-specific prefix

**Migration**: Users should update any scripts or documentation that reference the old command names:
- Old: `/project:init`, `/project:new-feature`, etc.
- New: `/sdd-init`, `/sdd-new-feature`, etc.

**Rationale**: The `project:` namespace was redundant since the plugin is already namespaced as "sdd". Using `sdd-` prefix follows common CLI tool patterns (like `git-`, `npm-`) and makes commands more concise.

## [1.8.3] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- **plugin manifest**: Added commands array to plugin.json for command discovery
  - References all 5 command files with relative paths:
    - `./commands/init.md`
    - `./commands/new-feature.md`
    - `./commands/implement-plan.md`
    - `./commands/verify-spec.md`
    - `./commands/generate-snapshot.md`
  - Enables Claude Code to automatically discover and register plugin commands
  - Uses relative paths with `./` prefix for portability

### Updated Files

- `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: Added commands array, bumped to 1.8.3
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`: Bumped to 1.8.3

### Impact

This enhancement improves plugin command registration:
- **Automatic discovery**: Claude Code can now discover commands from manifest
- **Better UX**: Commands appear in autocomplete and help documentation
- **Standards compliance**: Follows Claude Code plugin manifest specification
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for command references

**Technical Note**: The commands array contains file path references (strings) rather than command metadata objects. Each path points to a command markdown file with frontmatter containing the command's name and description.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed

- **new-feature command**: Fixed workflow order to collect feature name before branch check
  - **Issue**: Command suggested `feature/<feature-name>` branch before collecting the feature name
  - **Fix**: Reordered flow to collect feature name first (Step 1), then check branch (Step 2)
  - **New flow**:
    1. Collect feature name (from argument or prompt)
    2. Check git branch and suggest `feature/<actual-feature-name>`
    3. Collect remaining information (issue, domain, description)
    4-6. Create spec, plan, and review

### Updated Files

- `commands/new-feature.md`: Reordered steps, updated examples, clarified important notes
- `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: Bumped to 1.8.2
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`: Bumped to 1.8.2

### Impact

This fix ensures a logical workflow:
- **Feature name available**: Branch suggestion now uses the actual feature name
- **Better UX**: Users see the correct branch suggestion immediately
- **Logical flow**: Name → Branch → Details makes more sense
- **Examples updated**: All three examples now show correct order

**Before (incorrect):**
```
Step 0: Check branch (suggests feature/<feature-name> without knowing name)
Step 1: Collect feature name
```

**After (correct):**
```
Step 1: Collect feature name
Step 2: Check branch (suggests feature/<actual-feature-name>)
Step 3: Collect remaining information
```

## [1.8.1] - 2026-01-12

### Enhanced

- **typescript-standards skill**: Added three critical module system rules
  - **Named exports only**: Prohibit default exports, enforce named exports for better IDE support and refactoring
  - **ES modules only**: Prohibit CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`), enforce ES module syntax (`import`/`export`)
  - **Import through index.ts only**: Prohibit bypassing module public APIs, enforce importing only from `index.ts` files

### New Rules

1. **Named Exports Only:**
   - ✅ `export const createUser = ...`
   - ✅ `export interface User { ... }`
   - ❌ `export default createUser` (NEVER)
   - **Why**: Better IDE autocomplete, explicit imports, easier to find usages, no ambiguity

2. **ES Modules Only:**
   - ✅ `import { createUser } from './user.js'`
   - ✅ `export { updateUser } from './user.js'`
   - ❌ `const { createUser } = require('./user')` (NEVER)
   - ❌ `module.exports = createUser` (NEVER)
   - **Why**: Standard JavaScript, statically analyzable (tree-shaking), async by nature, modern tooling requirement

3. **Import Through index.ts Only:**
   - ✅ `import { createUser } from '../user'` (from module's public API)
   - ❌ `import { createUser } from '../user/createUser.js'` (NEVER bypass index.ts)
   - ❌ `import { helper } from '../user/internal/helper.js'` (NEVER access internals)
   - **Why**: Module encapsulation, clean public APIs, easier refactoring, clear module boundaries

### Updated Files

- `skills/typescript-standards.md`: Added "Module System Rules" section with 3 subsections
- Updated summary checklist with 3 new items
- `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: Bumped to 1.8.1
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`: Bumped to 1.8.1

### Impact

These rules strengthen code quality and maintainability:

**Named Exports Benefits**:
- IDE can autocomplete exact names
- Refactoring tools work correctly
- Easy to find all usages with search
- Import statements are explicit and clear

**ES Modules Benefits**:
- Standard JavaScript module system
- Tree-shaking works (reduces bundle size)
- Static analysis possible (better tooling)
- Async loading supported natively
- TypeScript tooling expects ES modules

**Index.ts Import Benefits**:
- Modules control what's public vs private
- Internal files can be refactored without breaking imports
- Clear separation of public API from implementation
- Better encapsulation (information hiding)
- Easier to understand module boundaries

**Example:**
```typescript
// Module structure
user/
├── index.ts           # Public API: export { createUser, User }
├── createUser.ts      # Implementation (private)
└── internal/          # Internal helpers (private)
    └── validator.ts

// Correct usage (imports from public API)
import { createUser } from '../user';

// Wrong usage (bypasses public API)
import { createUser } from '../user/createUser.js';  // ❌ NEVER
```

## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-12

### Enhanced

- **init command**: Added support for external specification files
  - **New argument**: `--spec <path>` to initialize project from existing spec
  - **Phase 0**: Parse and load external spec, extract project metadata
  - **Smart defaults**: Use extracted values (name, description, domain) as defaults in prompts
  - **Automatic integration**: External spec becomes initial feature specification
  - **Plan generation**: Automatically creates implementation plan from external spec
  - **Domain extraction**: Extracts key terms and adds to glossary
  - **INDEX/SNAPSHOT updates**: Automatically registers imported spec

### New Usage

```bash
# Initialize from external spec
/project:init my-app --spec /path/to/requirements.md

# Initialize from spec, will prompt for project name
/project:init --spec /path/to/product-spec.md
```

### Workflow Changes

1. **Phase 0 (New)**: Parse arguments and load external spec if provided
   - Reads external spec file
   - Extracts project name, description, domain, definitions, requirements
   - Validates spec file existence and readability

2. **Phase 1 (Enhanced)**: Uses extracted values as defaults in prompts
   - Prompts show: "Project name [<extracted-default>]: "
   - Users can accept defaults or override

3. **Step 3 (Enhanced)**: External spec integration after template copy
   - Creates `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/SPEC.md` from external spec
   - Adds proper frontmatter with source tracking
   - Generates `PLAN.md` with implementation phases
   - Updates INDEX.md and SNAPSHOT.md
   - Extracts domain terms to glossary

4. **Step 5 (Enhanced)**: Different completion messages
   - External spec path: Shows plan review and implementation next steps
   - Standard path: Shows feature creation next steps

### Updated Files

- `commands/init.md`: Added --spec argument, Phase 0, external spec integration workflow
- `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: Bumped to 1.8.0
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`: Bumped to 1.8.0

### Impact

This enhancement enables seamless project initialization from existing specifications:

**Use Cases**:
- **Product requirements**: Import PRD documents as initial specs
- **Design documents**: Start implementation from design specs
- **Migration projects**: Import legacy system specs
- **Customer requirements**: Use client-provided specs directly
- **RFP responses**: Initialize from RFP documents

**Benefits**:
- **Time savings**: No manual spec creation or copying
- **Consistency**: Automatic formatting and structure
- **Traceability**: Source tracking in frontmatter
- **Immediate planning**: Auto-generated implementation plan
- **Domain capture**: Automatic glossary population

**Example workflow**:
1. Receive product-requirements.md from product team
2. Run: `/project:init my-product --spec product-requirements.md`
3. Review generated plan: `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/PLAN.md`
4. Start implementation: `/project:implement-plan specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/PLAN.md`

## [1.7.1] - 2026-01-12

### Changed

- **init command**: Renamed from `init-project` to `init` for brevity
  - Command file: `commands/init-project.md` → `commands/init.md`
  - Command name: `/project:init-project` → `/project:init`
  - Updated all documentation references (README.md, QUICKSTART.md, CLAUDE.md)
  - Added `namespace: "sdd"` to plugin manifest

### Updated Files

- `commands/init.md`: Updated command name and frontmatter
- `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: Added namespace, bumped to 1.7.1
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`: Bumped to 1.7.1
- `README.md`: Updated command references
- `QUICKSTART.md`: Updated command references and file tree
- `CLAUDE.md`: Updated command references

### Impact

This change simplifies the command interface:
- **Shorter command**: `/project:init` vs `/project:init-project`
- **More intuitive**: Common convention (like `git init`, `npm init`)
- **Consistent naming**: Aligns with industry standards
- **Namespace added**: Ensures plugin uniqueness in marketplace

**Migration**: Users should update any scripts or documentation that reference `/project:init-project` to use `/project:init` instead.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

- **frontend-dev agent**: Major architectural overhaul with MVVM, page-based organization, TanStack ecosystem, and TailwindCSS
  - **MVVM Architecture (Mandatory)**:
    - Strict separation: Model (business logic) → ViewModel (hooks) → View (React components)
    - Page-based organization: `src/pages/<PageName>/` with index.ts, Page.tsx, usePageViewModel.ts
    - ViewModels as hooks: One `useXViewModel.ts` per page that connects Model to View
    - Model layer separation: Business logic in `src/models/`, API calls in `src/services/`
  - **Directory Structure**:
    - `src/pages/` - Page components with dedicated subdirectories
    - `src/components/` - Shared presentational components
    - `src/viewmodels/` - Shared ViewModel hooks
    - `src/models/` - Domain logic (the "M" in MVVM)
    - `src/services/` - API clients and external services
    - `src/stores/` - Global state (Zustand)
    - `src/types/` - Generated types from OpenAPI contract
  - **TanStack Ecosystem (Mandatory)**:
    - **TanStack Router**: All routing and navigation (replaces React Router)
    - **TanStack Query**: All server state management (mandatory for API calls)
    - **TanStack Table**: All tabular data display
    - **TanStack Form**: Complex forms with validation
  - **TailwindCSS (Mandatory)**:
    - All styling MUST use Tailwind utility classes
    - NO inline styles, NO CSS files (except Tailwind setup), NO CSS-in-JS libraries
    - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
    - Dark mode support with `dark:` variants
    - Use `clsx` for conditional classes
  - **State Management**:
    - Server state: TanStack Query (all API data)
    - Global client state: Zustand (auth, theme, preferences)
    - Local client state: useState (forms, UI toggles)
    - URL state: TanStack Router (pagination, filters)
  - **Updated Rules**:
    - Strict MVVM - Views never contain business logic
    - Page-based organization - Every page in dedicated subdirectory
    - ViewModels as hooks - One per page, handles all business logic
    - TailwindCSS only - Utility-first styling approach
    - TanStack ecosystem - All routing, state, tables, and forms

### Updated Files

- **frontend-dev agent**:
  - Added comprehensive MVVM architecture section with layer responsibilities
  - Added detailed directory structure with 9 subdirectories
  - Added mandatory page structure with complete code examples
  - Added TanStack ecosystem section (Router, Query, Table, Form)
  - Added TailwindCSS section with styling rules and examples
  - Updated component standards for presentational components
  - Updated state management table with 4 state types and tools
  - Added Zustand store example
  - Reorganized and expanded Rules section into 4 categories
  - Version bumped to 1.7.0 in plugin.json and marketplace.json

### Impact

This enhancement transforms frontend development with opinionated, modern architecture:

**MVVM Benefits**:
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Business logic isolated from UI
- **Testability**: ViewModels and Models can be unit tested without UI
- **Reusability**: Shared ViewModels and Models across pages
- **Maintainability**: Easy to locate and modify logic by layer

**Page-Based Organization**:
- **Scalability**: Each page is self-contained with its ViewModel
- **Discoverability**: Clear file structure, easy to find components
- **Code colocation**: Related files grouped together
- **Consistency**: Every page follows the same pattern

**TanStack Ecosystem**:
- **Modern routing**: Type-safe routes with TanStack Router
- **Powerful state**: Server state management with caching, refetching
- **Advanced tables**: Sorting, filtering, pagination out of the box
- **Form validation**: Built-in validation with TanStack Form

**TailwindCSS Benefits**:
- **Rapid development**: No context switching between files
- **Consistency**: Design system through configuration
- **Performance**: Optimized with PurgeCSS in production
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first utilities
- **Dark mode**: Built-in support

**Migration from 1.6.x**: Existing projects will need to:
1. Restructure to MVVM with `src/pages/` and ViewModels
2. Install TanStack packages (Router, Query, Table, Form)
3. Install and configure TailwindCSS
4. Migrate React Router to TanStack Router
5. Convert inline styles and CSS files to Tailwind utilities
6. Extract business logic from components to ViewModels

## [1.6.2] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed

- **TypeScript standards compliance**: Corrected invalid `readonly interface` syntax across all plugin files
  - **typescript-standards skill**: Removed `readonly` keyword from interface declaration (line 40)
    - Changed from `readonly interface User {` (invalid TypeScript)
    - Changed to `interface User {` (correct - readonly applies to properties, not interface)
  - **backend-dev agent**: Fixed all 4 instances of `readonly interface`:
    - Line 54: `ServerDependencies` interface
    - Line 80: `Config` interface (in main Config layer example)
    - Line 213: `DAL` interface
    - Line 295: `Config` interface (in logging example)
  - **Validation**: Confirmed no other TypeScript standards violations (arrow functions, immutability, native JS)

### Updated Files

- `skills/typescript-standards.md`: Fixed interface syntax in immutability example
- `agents/backend-dev.md`: Fixed 4 instances of incorrect interface syntax
- Version bumped to 1.6.2 in plugin.json and marketplace.json

### Impact

This fix ensures all code examples in the plugin demonstrate correct TypeScript syntax:
- **Standards compliance**: All examples now follow valid TypeScript syntax
- **Educational accuracy**: Developers using the plugin will learn correct patterns
- **Code generation**: Agents will generate syntactically correct TypeScript code
- **Type checking**: Examples will pass TypeScript compiler validation

**Technical note**: TypeScript does not support `readonly` as a modifier for interface declarations. The `readonly` keyword only applies to interface properties, type properties, and array/object types (e.g., `ReadonlyArray<T>`, `Readonly<T>`).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

- **backend-dev agent**: Enforced dotenv usage and prohibited direct environment variable access
  - **Mandatory dotenv**: Config layer must use `dotenv.config()` at the top of src/config/index.ts
  - **Config layer ONLY**: `process.env` access is FORBIDDEN outside src/config/
  - **Type-safe configuration**: All layers receive typed Config object, never raw environment variables
  - **Updated Layer 2 (Config)**: Added comprehensive dotenv example with validation and error handling
  - **Updated telemetry/logging**: Logger must receive log level from Config, not process.env
  - **Dependency injection**: BaseLogger created from Config, passed down to all layers
  - Added 6 explicit environment variable rules
  - Added 3 new rules to Rules section

### Updated Files

- **backend-dev agent**:
  - Layer 2 (Config): Added dotenv.config() requirement and comprehensive example
  - Added "Environment Variable Rules" section with 6 rules
  - Updated "Structured Logging" section to use Config instead of process.env
  - Updated "Logging by Layer" section to show baseLogger dependency injection
  - Updated "Build Order" step 2 to emphasize dotenv usage
  - Updated "Rules" section with 3 new rules:
    - dotenv is mandatory
    - NO direct process.env access
    - Type-safe configuration only

### Impact

This enhancement improves configuration management and type safety:
- **Prevents scattered env access**: All environment variables centralized in Config layer
- **Type safety**: Config interface provides compile-time guarantees
- **Validation**: Required env vars validated at startup with clear error messages
- **Testability**: Config can be mocked/injected for testing
- **Security**: Clearer control over environment variable access
- **Best practices**: Follows 12-factor app configuration principles

## [1.6.0] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

- **/project:implement-plan command**: Added mandatory domain documentation update phase
  - **New Step 2: Update Domain Documentation** - Required before any code implementation
  - Must update domain docs based on feature spec before writing code:
    1. **Glossary updates** (`specs/domain/glossary.md`): Add/update domain terms and concepts
    2. **Definition documentation** (`specs/domain/definitions/`): Create/update definition spec files
    3. **Architecture documentation** (`specs/architecture/`): Update architectural patterns and integration points
  - Includes verification checklist to confirm all documentation areas are addressed
  - Explicitly requires noting when no updates are needed (prevents skipping)
  - Renumbered subsequent steps (Execute Phases → 3, Track Progress → 4, Final Verification → 5)

### Updated Files

- **implement-plan command**:
  - Added comprehensive "Step 2: Update Domain Documentation" with three sub-sections
  - Each sub-section includes specific tasks and verification requirements
  - Added verification checklist with 5 checkboxes
  - Added "Important Notes" section explaining why domain docs must come first
  - Updated example to show domain documentation update workflow
  - Renumbered existing steps (2 → 3, 3 → 4, 4 → 5)

### Impact

This enhancement ensures domain knowledge is properly documented:
- **Prevents implementation drift**: Code cannot be written until domain is documented
- **Centralized knowledge**: Glossary, definitions, and architecture serve as single source of truth
- **Improved traceability**: Clear path from spec → domain docs → implementation
- **Better onboarding**: New team members can understand domain through centralized docs
- **Enforces best practices**: Domain-driven design principles built into workflow
- **No shortcuts**: Explicit verification prevents skipping documentation step

## [1.5.1] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

- **/project:new-feature command**: Added git branch check and feature branch suggestion
  - **Step 0: Check Git Branch** - New mandatory first step before collecting any information
  - Automatically detects if user is on `main` or `master` branch
  - Suggests creating a feature branch with naming pattern `feature/<feature-name>`
  - Allows user to:
    - Accept suggested branch name (creates branch automatically)
    - Provide custom branch name
    - Decline and proceed on main/master (with warning and confirmation)
  - If already on a feature branch, proceeds without interruption
  - Follows git workflow best practices while maintaining user control

### Updated Files

- **new-feature command**:
  - Added Step 0: Check Git Branch (runs before collecting feature information)
  - Renumbered existing steps (Collect Info → 1, Create Spec → 2, Create Plan → 3, Review → 4)
  - Added "Important Notes" section explaining branch check behavior
  - Added three example interactions showing different scenarios:
    - Example 1: On main branch (creates feature branch)
    - Example 2: Already on feature branch (proceeds normally)
    - Example 3: On main branch (user declines, sees warning)

### Impact

This enhancement encourages proper git workflow:
- Prevents accidental feature creation directly on main/master
- Suggests consistent branch naming convention (`feature/<name>`)
- Educates users about best practices
- Maintains flexibility for users who need to work on main/master
- Reduces risk of merge conflicts and improves code review process

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-11

### Changed

- **Command renamed**: `/project:implement-spec` → `/project:implement-plan`
  - Better reflects that the command implements from a plan (which references a spec)
  - Command now takes path to PLAN.md instead of SPEC.md
  - Example: `/project:implement-plan specs/features/2026/01/11/user-auth/PLAN.md`

### Updated Files

- **implement-plan command** (renamed from implement-spec.md):
  - Updated command name, description, and usage examples
  - Changed to read PLAN.md first, then SPEC.md from same directory
  - Updated flow documentation to reflect plan-centric approach
- **Documentation files**: Updated all references to use new command name
  - CLAUDE.md
  - plugin/README.md
  - plugin/QUICKSTART.md
  - plugin/templates/project/README.md
  - plugin/templates/project/CLAUDE.md

### Impact

This change clarifies the implementation workflow:
- Plans are the execution documents, specs are the requirements
- Command name now matches what it operates on (plan, not spec)
- Consistent with the pattern where plan references spec via `./SPEC.md`
- More intuitive for users: "implement the plan" vs "implement the spec"

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-11

### Changed

- **Directory structure**: Features now use date-based organization
  - Feature specs: `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/SPEC.md` (was: `specs/features/<feature-name>/SPEC.md`)
  - Implementation plans: `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/PLAN.md` (was: `specs/plans/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/PLAN.md`)
  - Plans now live alongside their specs in the same directory
  - Removed separate `specs/plans/` directory

### Updated Files

- **spec-writer agent**: Updated location rules with date-based feature paths
- **planner agent**: Plans now stored alongside specs (not in separate plans/ directory)
- **planning skill**: Updated plan location and template
- **spec-writing skill**: Updated spec locations table with date-based organization
- **new-feature command**: Creates dated feature directories and sets creation date
- **init-project command**: Removed `specs/plans/` from directory structure
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated examples and Important Files table

### Impact

This change provides better organization and traceability:
- Chronological organization of features by creation date
- Specs and plans kept together in one location
- Easier to find features by when they were created
- Cleaner directory structure (no separate plans directory)
- Relative paths in plans (./SPEC.md) instead of absolute paths

### Migration Guide

For existing projects using the old structure:
- Move `specs/features/<feature-name>/SPEC.md` to `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/SPEC.md`
- Move `specs/plans/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/PLAN.md` to `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/PLAN.md`
- Use the `created` date from the spec frontmatter for the YYYY/MM/DD directory
- Delete empty `specs/plans/` directory

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

- **/project:init-project command**: Completely redesigned with approval-based workflow
  - **Phase 1: Gather Information** - Prompts for project details before any file creation
    - Project name and description
    - Primary business domain
    - Tech stack confirmation
    - Component selection (Server, Webapp, Helm, Testing, CI/CD)
  - **Phase 2: Show Configuration Summary** - Displays complete plan with directory structure
  - **Phase 3: User Approval** - Explicitly asks for confirmation before creating any files
  - **Phase 4: Project Creation** - Only executes after user approval
  - Customizable component selection (choose which parts to include)
  - Template variable substitution for project name, description, and domain
  - Conditional directory/file creation based on selected components
  - More predictable and transparent initialization process

### Impact

This update transforms /project:init-project from an automatic file generator into an interactive, approval-based tool:
- No files created until user explicitly approves
- Users can customize which components to include
- Clear visibility into what will be created before it happens
- Follows same approval pattern as spec-writer and planner agents
- Better user experience with informed decision-making

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-11

- Centralized TypeScript standards in one location
- Centralized Testkube documentation in testing skill
- Improved consistency between backend and frontend development

## [1.1.2] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

- **CLAUDE.md**: Added strict version management workflow
  - Enforces required sequence: code changes → version bump → CHANGELOG update → commit
  - Prevents version bumps without corresponding CHANGELOG entries
  - Includes example workflow for clarity
  - Makes version management process explicit and mandatory

This ensures all version changes are properly documented before being committed.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

  - Clear directive to NOT declare implementation complete until all tests pass and all verification steps are finished
  - Prevents incomplete implementations and ensures thorough validation

### Added

- `.gitignore` file to exclude macOS `.DS_Store` files

This ensures the implement-spec command follows a rigorous, complete workflow that validates all requirements before declaring success.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added

- **Version management system**: Automatic version bumping across plugin files
  - Updates both `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` - Plugin overview and features
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Getting started guide
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file

#### Agents (10 total)

All agents follow the methodology where specs are the source of truth:

1. **spec-writer** (opus) - Creates and maintains markdown specifications
2. **planner** (opus) - Breaks specs into phased implementation plans
3. **api-designer** (sonnet) - Designs OpenAPI contracts in `components/contract/`
4. **frontend-dev** (sonnet) - Implements React components consuming contract types
5. **backend-dev** (sonnet) - Implements Node.js backend with 5-layer architecture
6. **db-advisor** (opus) - Reviews database performance (advisory only)
7. **devops** (sonnet) - Manages Kubernetes, Helm, and Testkube
8. **ci-dev** (sonnet) - Creates CI/CD pipelines
9. **tester** (sonnet) - Writes tests that run via Testkube
10. **reviewer** (opus) - Reviews code for spec compliance and quality

#### Skills (4 total)

Reusable knowledge modules:

1. **spec-writing** - Templates and validation for specifications
2. **planning** - Templates for implementation plans
3. **testing** - Test patterns and Testkube execution
4. **spec-index** - Spec registry and snapshot generation

#### Commands (5 total)

Project lifecycle automation:

1. **/project:init** - Initialize new project from templates
2. **/project:new-feature** - Start new feature with spec and plan
3. **/project:implement-spec** - Orchestrate implementation across agents
4. **/project:verify-spec** - Verify implementation against spec
5. **/project:generate-snapshot** - Regenerate INDEX.md and SNAPSHOT.md

#### Templates

Project scaffolding files:

**Project Root:**
- `README.md` - Project documentation template
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code context template
- `package.json` - Workspace configuration

**Specs:**
- `INDEX.md` - Spec registry template
- `SNAPSHOT.md` - Product snapshot template
- `glossary.md` - Domain terminology template

**Components:**
- `contract/openapi.yaml` - Base OpenAPI specification
- `contract/package.json` - Type generation scripts
- `server/package.json` - Backend dependencies
- `server/tsconfig.json` - Strict TypeScript config
- `webapp/package.json` - Frontend dependencies
- `webapp/tsconfig.json` - React TypeScript config

#### Scripts (3 total)

Python utilities for spec management:

1. **validate-spec.py** - Validates spec frontmatter and format
2. **generate-index.py** - Generates `specs/INDEX.md` from all specs
3. **generate-snapshot.py** - Generates `specs/SNAPSHOT.md` from active specs

All scripts are executable (`chmod +x`).

#### Key Features

- **Contract-First Development**: OpenAPI drives type generation for both frontend and backend
- **5-Layer Backend Architecture**: Server → Config → Controller → Model → DAL
- **Strict TypeScript**: All `readonly`, no mutations, no `any`
- **Kubernetes-Native**: Helm charts and Testkube for environment parity
- **OpenTelemetry**: Built-in observability with logs, metrics, and traces
- **Git as State Machine**: PR = draft, merged to main = active
- **Issue Tracking**: Every spec must reference a tracking issue

#### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js 20, TypeScript 5, Express
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript 5, Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit), Testkube (integration/E2E)
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Helm
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Pino

#### Design Decisions

- 10 specialized agents (not more, not less)
- 5 components: contract, server, webapp, helm, testing
- Required `issue` field in all specs
- Arrow functions only in backend
- Native JavaScript only (no lodash, immer, ramda)
- No implicit global code in frontend
- Testkube for all non-unit tests

#### File Count

- 36 total files created
- 10 agent definitions
- 4 skill definitions
- 5 command definitions
- 14 template files
- 3 utility scripts

### Future Enhancements (Not in v1.0)

The following were explicitly scoped out for future versions:

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
- Custom hooks
- AsyncAPI for event-driven architectures
- Contract testing with Pact
- Additional CI/CD platforms (GitLab, CircleCI)
- Additional deployment targets (AWS ECS, Cloud Run)
