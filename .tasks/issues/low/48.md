# Task 48: Organize plugin skills directory by cohesion

## Description

The `.claude/skills/` directory contains skills that could be better organized by grouping related skills together. Need to:
- Analyze existing skills and identify cohesive groups (e.g., git/commit-related, testing-related, coding-standards)
- Create subdirectories for skill groups if appropriate
- Update any references to skill paths
- Improve discoverability and maintainability of the skills collection
