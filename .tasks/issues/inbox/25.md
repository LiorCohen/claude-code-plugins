# Task 25: Planner must block on open questions in specs

## Description

When specs contain open questions, implementation cannot proceed. The planner must:
- Detect open questions in specs before planning
- Block/halt if unresolved questions exist
- Require questions to be resolved before allowing implementation to begin
- Provide clear guidance on which questions need answers
