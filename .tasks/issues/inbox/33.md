# Task 33: Tests are not useful - need better test creation approach

## Description

Current tests don't capture important things. Need:
- A better methodology for creating meaningful tests
- Tests that verify actual behavior, not just structure
- Focus on what matters for the plugin's functionality
- Possibly rethink the testing strategy entirely
