# Task 15: Planner is too rigid and template-driven

## Description

The planner follows a naive, robotic predefined plan template. Instead, it should use **planning rules** that guide decision-making, not a fixed plan structure. This would allow for more adaptive, context-aware planning. Templates should be guidance, not constraints - encourage thoughtful, context-aware writing and allow flexibility to deviate when appropriate. Produce rich, meaningful specs rather than formulaic checkbox-filling.
