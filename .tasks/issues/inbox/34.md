# Task 34: Audit agent assumptions around interactivity

## Description

Identify the different assumptions we've made with our agents and evaluate whether these assumptions make sense when interactivity is required as part of their processes:
- Which agents assume non-interactive execution?
- Which processes actually need user input mid-flow?
- Are there agents that should pause for feedback but don't?
- Are there agents that block unnecessarily when they could proceed?
