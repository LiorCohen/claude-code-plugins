# Task 20: Plugin installation debugging skill + workflow fix

## Description

Currently forced to delete `~/.claude/plugins` to use the marketplace/plugin in a new project. This is broken. Need:
- A debugging skill to diagnose plugin installation issues
- A sane workflow for developing/testing plugins locally
- Clear guidance on how plugin resolution works
- Fix whatever is causing the need to manually clear the plugins cache
