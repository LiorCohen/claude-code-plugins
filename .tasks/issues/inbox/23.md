# Task 23: Autocomplete for SDD command arguments

## Description

Need autocomplete support for **arguments** to SDD commands, not the command names themselves. For example:
- `/sdd-implement <tab>` should show available change directories
- `/sdd-new-change <tab>` should suggest component names
- Argument completion based on context (existing specs, components, etc.)
