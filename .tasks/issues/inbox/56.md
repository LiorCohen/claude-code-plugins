# Task 56: Create architecture skill with meaningful guidance

## Description

The current `specs/architecture/` approach is naive and not very useful. Need a proper architecture skill that provides:
- Meaningful architectural guidance beyond just listing components
- Decision records (ADRs) methodology
- System context and container diagrams guidance
- Integration patterns and boundaries
- Non-functional requirements capture
- Trade-off analysis framework
- Evolution and migration planning
