# Task 43: CI/CD components and .github folder integration

## Description

Need to figure out how to handle separate CI/CD components and how they integrate with the root `.github/` folder:
- How do CI/CD component types work with monorepo structure?
- Should workflows be defined per-component or centralized?
- How to handle component-specific vs shared workflows
- Relationship between component specs and actual `.github/workflows/` files
