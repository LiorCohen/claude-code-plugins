# Task 52: Clean up .gitkeep and placeholder content during implementation

## Description

When changes are implemented and actual content is added to directories, ensure that:
- `.gitkeep` files are removed once the directory has real content
- Placeholder content (example files, TODO comments, stub implementations) is replaced or removed
- The implementation phase should detect and clean up scaffolding artifacts
- Prevents stale placeholders from accumulating in the codebase
