# Task 90: Skills standards audit across all 34 plugin skills

## Description

Run a comprehensive audit of all 34 plugin skills against the current skills-standards specification. This audit checks frontmatter, self-containment, schema conventions (including the new schemas/ subdirectory requirement), dependency graph, code blocks, and environment preconditions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 34 SKILL.md files checked against the full skills-standards checklist
- [ ] Dependency graph built with cycle detection
- [ ] Cross-skill file references identified and quoted
- [ ] Schema location violations identified (root-level vs schemas/ subdirectory)
- [ ] Full audit report written as report.md in this task folder
