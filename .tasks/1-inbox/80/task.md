# Task 80: Plans should become YAML files

## Description

Convert plan files from markdown format (`plan.md`) to YAML format (`plan.yaml`). This would make plans machine-readable and easier to parse programmatically, while maintaining human readability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Plans are stored as YAML files instead of markdown
- [ ] Plan schema is defined and documented
- [ ] Existing plans are migrated to the new format
- [ ] Task management skill updated to handle YAML plans
