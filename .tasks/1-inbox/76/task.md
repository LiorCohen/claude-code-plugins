# Task 76: Git worktrees for parallel spec/plan execution

## Description

Add support for git worktrees to enable parallel execution of specs and plans. Git worktrees allow multiple working directories to share the same git repository, enabling concurrent work on different branches without switching.

This would allow:
- Running multiple specs or plans in parallel on different worktrees
- Avoiding branch switching conflicts during concurrent operations
- Better isolation between parallel implementation tasks

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document git worktree usage patterns for SDD workflows
- [ ] Add commands or skill support for creating/managing worktrees
- [ ] Enable parallel execution of specs across worktrees
- [ ] Enable parallel execution of plans across worktrees
- [ ] Handle worktree cleanup after task completion
- [ ] Integrate with existing task management workflow
