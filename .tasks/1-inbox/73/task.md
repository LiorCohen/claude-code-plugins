# Task 73: User instructions memory for plugin overrides

## Description

Add a mechanism for users to provide custom prompts/instructions that override default plugin behavior. This would allow users to customize how the plugin operates based on their preferences without modifying the plugin itself.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can provide custom instructions that persist across sessions
- [ ] User instructions can override default plugin prompts/behavior
- [ ] Instructions are stored in a user-accessible location
- [ ] Clear precedence rules for user vs default instructions
