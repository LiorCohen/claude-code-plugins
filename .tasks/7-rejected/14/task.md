# Task 14: Unclear when to run type generation ✗

<!-- Original content preserved below -->

## Description

Need to document/clarify when type generation should be run in the workflow. Is it:
- After spec creation?
- Before implementation?
- Automatically as part of another command?
- Manually triggered?
