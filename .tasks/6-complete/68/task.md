# Task 68: Plans should focus on WHAT, not HOW ✓

## Summary

Updated plan templates and documentation to focus on WHAT (outcomes, affected files, tests) rather than HOW (implementation details, code snippets, step-by-step instructions).

## Details

- Updated task-level plan template with Changes, Dependencies, Tests sections
- Updated change-level templates to use "Outcome" instead of "Tasks" checklists
- Added "Does NOT Contain" column to SPEC vs PLAN table
- Added "Plan Content Guidelines" section
- Added spec self-sufficiency principle statement
- Added Tests sections to all three change-level templates (feature, bugfix, refactor)
- Fixed docs/workflows.md: "How to build it" → "Execution phases and agent coordination"
